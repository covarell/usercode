This guideline will be added.

Agreed to remove the pull plots in the mass case. Chi2 can be added on the 
mass plots.
 
However in lifetime plots this is not extremely reliable: chi2 assumes 
Gaussian pulls, while in the tails we have entries with a small number of
events (or even fractional, due to non-uniform binning). We will remove 
the chi2, but leave the pull plots (which anyway show the reader that the
pulls do not exhibit "runs", i.e. sets of adjacent points with all
positive or all negative pulls).

This is already checked. "Cross section" is used as a standalone noun,
"cross-section" when it is an attribute.

From real data: muon efficiencies, yields, B-fractions.
From MC: acceptance, rho factors.

There is no motivation even for one exponential... It is an empirical 
function and alternative shapes are investigated and considered as
systematic uncertainties.
