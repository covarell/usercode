Agreed to remove the pull plots in the mass case. Chi2 can be added on the 
mass plots.
 
However in lifetime plots this is not extremely reliable: chi2 assumes 
Gaussian pulls, while in the tails we have entries with a small number of
events (or even fractional, due to non-uniform binning). We will remove 
the chi2, but leave the pull plots (which anyway show the reader that the
pulls do not exhibit "runs", i.e. sets of adjacent points with all
positive or all negative pulls).

This is already checked. "Cross section" is used as a standalone noun,
"cross-section" when it is an attribute.

From real data: muon efficiencies, yields, B-fractions.

There is no motivation even for one exponential... It is an empirical

we don't know what the polarization is, so in order to apply acceptance corrections we need 
to assume one. That's why we wrote "assumed" here.

it is defined by the equation.

this is about the charmonium momentum spectrum, not the polarization.

>  ---
>  --- Lines 166-167: Is the FSR not taken into account in simulation?."

FSR is of course present in the simulation. The issue here is that, because of FSR, 
the reconstructed dimuon momentum may not be equal to the Psi momentum. 
What we reconstruct is the dimuon, but what we want to measure is the psi's double-differential 
cross section. Ideally the proper way  of dealing with this would be an unfolding procedure 
(of the kind used in b-jet analyses) independent of the generated psi spectrum. 
Since the effect is small, however, we decided to evaluate its size by using either the dimuon 
or the psi kinematic variables in the acceptance map, and quote the difference in the results 
as a systematic uncertainty.

It is explained in the muon efficiency references given above, and was explained in the previous Jpsi paper quoted in the beginning, so we didnt think it necessary to repeat it here.

epsilon(mu) is defined in eq(4): it comes from T&P on data, as stated right before eq. 4.
The T&P technique has also been used on MC to correct for possible biases of the T&P method
(included in the rho factor)


>
>  line 195: Define more precisely what is being factorised.

 With rho=1, eq(5) essentially expresses the dimuon detection efficiency 
(excluding vertexing requests)  as the product of the single muon efficiencies. 
As the text says, the rho factor is actually defined by eq. 5

> lines 201-204 and eq. (6): define what is measured from real data and what

It was explained in the previous paragraphs. The acceptance is obtained from simulation, 
the efficiency essentially from data.


>  ---
>  --- Line 203: "estimated original number"?
>  --- line 204: of events --> of MC events (?)

we measure a number of events in data but we want to 
know how many events were really produced in the first place, 
so we divide by an efficiency factor. This we called
the "estimated original number" of events (in data, meaning: in real life - of course the data only contain the events that passed the selection cuts).


> line 215: Why "5.1 Inclusive cross-section determination" is a subchapter  of "5. Acceptance and

It used to be a separate section, but it was suggested that we split it in half (yield determinatio - cross section determination) inserting the acceptance section in between. This was supposed 
to follow more closely the logical and procedural steps of the analysis.
