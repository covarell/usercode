These will be indeed added in the paper as plots. Tables will continue to
stay on the Twiki page (and eventually moved to the journal webserver) see 
answers to other reviewers).

This is the same. It will be rephrased in many places.

Yes, this is correct. Since this needs to be done only at generator level, 
the person will not need CMS simulation to extract the correct 
cross-section once the polarization is measured.

The fact that the B-fraction are not presented explicitly (this will 
change anyway) does not mean that the final results do not include them.
Prompt (non-prompt) cross-sections are obtained multiplying the inclusive
result by 1-f_B (f_B), and this is actually the main statistical error.
Hence the need to use as much data as possible and including type-A for
this determination.

 well I think that in principle there is a difference between "knowledge" and "modelling".  
One may know perfectly well the material, including electronic chips, cables and all, but 
one may find it hard, or impossible, or not worth while to simulate it perfectly in the software.

[: RIVEDERE] Maybe we can take out the reference to the muon peak and just mention the systematics due to

 It seems clear to me that it refers to the absolute value of the rapidity. Technically one 
could also object that "forward" is misleading, since it includes what one would call "backward".

 As the text was supposed to explain, the parameter in the eq. only appears to indicate 
a dependence on the polarization.

> So why are there various polarization scenarios being mentioned here?

 because in general the acceptance does depend on the assumed polarization. 
The polarization is taken to be null in the default analysis, but then four particular polarization scenarios are considered, for which lambda_theta is nonzero (while lambda_phi is null).

 In principle lambda_phi should appear in eq. 1 too. Lambda_phi appears in the general formula, but is null in the four extreme polarization cases we actually considered. So in practice it is not varied. 
Note that these parameters refer to a particular frame, so technically the acceptance depends on yet another index, specifying which frame is being considered. This would have made eq.1 too  heavily detailed for its illustrative purpose, so we kept the lambda_theta as a mere reminder of the polarization dependence. [VEDERE]

The AN is incorrect, we'll change that. The default acceptance was determined using the events as generated by Pythia.

 I think this is already stated at the beginning, when we say that the rho factor represents a 
correction to the factorization hypothesis. The proposed clause sounds confusing to me, since it would 
suggest that the factorization hypothesis is the bias the previous sentence refers to.

 we tried this for the Jpsi paper. The difference is that with this alternative method one relies 
on the MC spectrum inside a bin. We are convinced that the method we used 
correctly includes the "bias to higher efficiency*acceptance" in the statistical error.

It is only the left boundary of the left J/psi sideband (right boundary of

 The effect is ignored in the table, not in the results. Since the table only gives "typical" or "average" variations, it would have been misleading to quote a 19% (29%) as an upper limit, 
since it would have given the wrong impression of a 
uniformly high - or wildly fluctuating - systematic uncertainty, whereas it's only a border effect.
We thought the caption was clear enough on this point, but maybe it's not clear enough.

The total cross-section estimates include errors on the J/psi, psi' BRs
for the prompt and additionally the B -> J/psi, psi' BRs in the 
non-prompt. In the last case, this is a sizable contribution so it must be
added to the text. Thanks for spotting this,.

Changed.

Changed.

Already changed.

The CDF results were compared to a very old theoretical estimation, which 
is not examined here. The sentence in the introduction will be changed.
Our only statement is that our results are in agreement with the most
recent NRQCD calculations including color octet.

 removed  "the effects due to" and "to mitigate"?

 Yes, but since we are then extracting the BR from this discrepancy,
it is not a result worth being repeated in the conclusions.

 NO, METTIAMO 3.5!

* It does for some. Changed anyway.
