> Before going through the paper
> line by line, there are three confusing aspects of this paper.
> 
> The first confusing part of this paper is the fact that many of the promised results do not appear
> in the paper but only in a Twiki.  This includes the non-prompt to prompt ratios and the results
  without the acceptance correction.  As the length of the paper clearly precludes submission to PRL,
> I think all results should be included in the paper.  Specifically, I would add the following
> figures: duplicates of Figure 4 and 5 without the acceptance correction and plots of the non-prompt
> fractions for J/psi and Psi(2S).  The remaining information on the twiki are the corrections to the
> null polarization for the 4 extreme polarization scenarios.  I don't know how useful these will be
  in the end.  I think they could be placed in an appendix and let the editor decide what to do.
> 
> The most confusing aspect is understanding the various ways that polarization is dealt with.  It is
> hard to keep track of everything as it enters in many places.  From what I can tell, all of the
> results actually in the paper come from correcting for acceptance assuming no polarization.  The
> results which do not correct for acceptance are only in the Twiki.  If this continues to be true
  then I recommend making this clear from the beginning (lines 21-28).  I would call the results
> presented in the paper (fully corrected) the default analysis.  Then I would state that the results
> without acceptance correction are available online.  I am also confused about what the naming and
> usefulness of the results without acceptance correction.  The phrase often used is "results are also
  given referred to the CMS detector acceptance region."  Is this superior to "results are given
> without correcting for acceptance."?  The word that seems out of place is "referred".  Other than
> the naming, how can these results actually be used in the future once a polarization measurement has
> been made?  If I understand this correctly, to use these results, a person would need to generate
> J/psi or Psi(2S) events in each of the pT and |y| bins and measure the fraction of the events in
> which both muons are inside acceptance (|eta|<1.2 and pT>4 GeV or 1.2<|eta|<2.4 and pT>3.3 GeV).  Is
> this correct?  Maybe this can be made clear when these results are presented.
> 
> The last confusing bit is for exactly what results are Type-A dimuons in the barrel region allowed.
> Based on lines 104-106, these dimuons are only used for the non-prompt fraction determination.  Does
> this mean they are not used for the prompt and non-prompt individual cross section but they are used
> for the ratio?  If that is true, and given that the ratio plot was not deemed important enough to go
> in the paper, it seems much easier to exclude the Type-A dimuons from the entire analysis.  If they
> are included, when the results are presented, it should be mentioned which results include Type-A

> L2-4: Heavy-flavour production includes quarkonium production.  Either remove "and quarkonium" or
> add "Open" before heavy-flavour".  Also, the last clause "via measurements of production cross

> L5: Change "quarkonium" to "charmonium" as there is no bottomonium here.
