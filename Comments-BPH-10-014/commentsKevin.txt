These are now indeed added in the paper as plots. Tables will continue to
stay on the Twiki page. The Twiki info is only a temporary entry and 
will be changed into the proper link to the journal web server at submission 
time (method suggested by R. Tenchini and used in many other CMS papers).

These will also stay on the Twiki page for the moment.

This is the same. It will be rephrased in many places.

Yes, this is correct. Since this needs to be done only at generator level, 
the person will not need CMS simulation to extract the correct 
cross-section once the polarization is measured.

This is impossible, see answer below.

It is now.

The fact that the B-fraction are not presented explicitly (this will 
change anyway) does not mean that the final results do not include them.
Prompt (non-prompt) cross-sections are obtained multiplying the inclusive
result by 1-f_B (f_B), and this is actually the main statistical error.
Hence the need to use as much data as possible and including type-A for
this determination.

It affects the size of the color octet contribution in the total cross section,

they must be provided as generator tuning parameters.

 well I think that in principle there is a difference between "knowledge" and "modelling".  
One may know perfectly well the material, including electronic chips, cables and all, but 
one may find it hard, or impossible, or not worth while to simulate it perfectly in the software.

The paragraph is here because this is where the tracking is mentioned, 
exactly like in the published Jpsi paper. pT calibration issues affecting the
acceptance (and so the pT/y measurements) are detailed in the corresponding

 It seems clear to us that it refers to the absolute value of the rapidity. 
Technically one 
could also object that "forward" is misleading, since it includes what one would call "backward".

> 
> Eq 1, L153-154: Lambda_theta needs to be defined. 

 As the text was supposed to explain, the parameter in the eq. only appears 
to indicate a dependence on the polarization. We added a definition, specifying
that they are independent parameters.

> Furthermore, in line 23 we are told that the polarization is 0 for prompt and from EvtGen for non-prompt
> So why are there various polarization scenarios being mentioned here?

Because in general the acceptance does depend on the assumed polarization. 
The polarization is taken to be null in the default analysis, but then four 
particular polarization scenarios are considered, for which lambda_theta is 
nonzero (while lambda_phi is still null).

 In principle lambda_phi should appear in eq. 1 too. Lambda_phi appears in 
the general formula, but is null in the four extreme polarization cases we 
actually considered. So in practice it is not varied. 
Note that these parameters refer to a particular frame, so technically the 
acceptance depends on yet another index, specifying which frame is being 
considered. This would have made eq.1 too  heavily detailed for its 
illustrative purpose, so we kept the lambda_theta as a mere reminder of the 
polarization dependence.

It is done with a particle gun, but events are (first) reweighted to the
expected Pythia spectrum.

> L166-172: Why should this be considered a sufficient systematic?  What about the uncertainty in the

The uncertainty on the measurement in [6] is not very clear, because it is
only given in p* bins and it's not specified which systematics are/are not
correlated between the bins to give the average alpha. Anyway the total
uncertainty should be smaller than the one considered here.

You mean, since the measurement came from Y(4S)...

> Is there reason to expect that the inclusive result from BaBar doesn't change with the addition of

Only the fact that f_u, f_d >> f_s, f_baryon and the fact that EvtGen 
(including B_s and Lambda_b decays) agrees well with the measurement.

No, the acceptance are mixed based on the measured non-prompt fractions.

 I think this is already stated at the beginning, when we say that the rho factor represents a 
correction to the factorization hypothesis. The proposed clause sounds confusing to me, since it would 
suggest that the factorization hypothesis is the bias the previous sentence refers to.

 We tried this for the old Jpsi paper. The difference is that with this 
alternative method one relies on the MC spectrum inside a bin. We are 
convinced that the method we used correctly includes the "bias to higher 
efficiency*acceptance" in the statistical error.

We only have FullSim samples with null and EvtGen polarization and we did not
find any difference in rho using one or the other. This ensures that rho 
(evaluated only on muons passing acceptance cuts, obviously) does not
depend on the polarization.

The sideband composition changes a lot moving from 2.5 to 4.2 GeV, because
double semileptonic b and c decays only "appear" above ~3.5 GeV, while fakes
decrease a lot with increasing mass. This is the reason for the strange "rise"
of the background that one can see in Fig. 1 right. So, sideband compositions
in terms of lifetime distributions can be trusted only in the vicinity of the
(corresponding) peaks, hence the choice of the close (and split) sidebands.

The total cross-section estimates indeed include errors on the J/psi, psi' BRs
for the prompt and additionally the B -> J/psi, psi' BRs in the 
non-prompt. In the last case, this is a sizable contribution so it must be
added to the text. Thanks for spotting this.

do not treat polarizzation on the same ground as the other systematic sources.

They are done in the correct way (i.e. the fitsr you mention)

Changed.

Changed.

Already changed.

The CDF results were compared to a very old theoretical estimation
(Khoze et al.), which is not examined here. 
The sentence in the introduction will be changed.
Our only statement is that our results are in agreement with the most
recent NRQCD calculations including color octet.

 removed  "the effects due to" and "to mitigate"?

 Yes, but since we are then extracting the BR from this discrepancy,
it is not a result worth being repeated in the conclusions.

We changed evreything to 3.

It does for some. Changed anyway.
