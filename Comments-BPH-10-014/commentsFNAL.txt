This is done in the tables in the Twiki that will be eventually added to
the journal webserver. Also, the acceptance-independent cross section is
also provided, which removes completely this source of uncertainty.

The sentence refers to cases with 3 muons in the events.
The 2-J/psi effect is expected at the permille level, using CSM 
expectation for J/psi + ccbar production and another factor 
BR(J/psi -> mumu) ~ 6%. So we neglect it in our calculations.

Less-binned samples give rise to rapidity-dependent effects in the mass
resolution, so more complicated functions should be used for this. From
the goodness-of-fit we judge that our assumptions are correct and we think 
that the error determined changing PDF forms also covers this uncertainty.

This is a good comment. In fact, in presence of significant pileup, this
requirement should be changed to the primary vertex that gives the smallest
pointing angle (i.e. the angle between the J/psi momentum vector
and the reconstructed flight path in the hypothesis of that PV).
With the very small pile-up of 2010 data, this was found to be sufficient.

No the per-event error is used also in the definition of F(l_J/psi, 
sigma_l). Formula is a bit incorrect, will be fixed.

Muon ID (even _global_ muon ID) works down to pT = 600 MeV/c, provided 
that you are in the very forward region, where the _total_ momentum of the
muon allows it anyway to go through the iron slabs of the end wheels.
Also in the forward you can have the special occurrence when the two
muons are exactly opposite in the x-y plane, giving rise to an object
with ~ 0 pT. In fact the measurement down to 0 pT is limited to the 
forward bin.

  [perhaps this could be clarified by making it clear eta is only used in reference to detector geometry?]

No, pseudorapidity and rapidity are used correctly. Specifically we use 
always eta for muons (where the inequality m_mu << pT_mu always holds) and
always y for charmonium (where m_psi << pT_psi does not necessarily hold).

We think figures are readable, references to colors will be removed.

No. This is done only to the generated MC samples to determine acceptance
uncertainties. No reweighting of the dimuon is done in the mainstream
analysis.

Ok, this will be improved (also noticed by other reviewers).

"color" and "center" will be UKed. The "-ize/ise" issue is debated, I think the -ize form is admitted 
in the UK (the cambridge online dictionary gives it as the standard form, specifying that the -ISE form is 
the "usual" one in UK). Personally I (Franco) prefer the "-ize" spelling.

This is a cultural bias, since in Italian longer sentences are more elegant and more "readable" than longer sequences of shorter sentences. Here we have to trust native readers/writers. [FL]

A full stop after "pixels" would imply that the silicon tracker only consists in the pixel detector [FL]

Changed to: 

Muons that bend towards each other in the magnetic field are called dimuons of type A, while  muons 
that bend away from each other are type-B dimuons. 
[I left the hyphen but I'm not sure whether it's necesary here, because "type A" is  more a definition than just an attribute. 
Inverted commas, maybe? Or italic?]


> - again ":" page 3,line 127 --> a full stop, and a new sentence started

What is it you guys have against colons? :-) Here (and elsewhere) the colon 
was supposed to introduce the explanation of the word or sentences immediately preceding it.
But again, we might be biased by our being Italian [See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(punctuation)  ]


> - page 4,line 135, the parenthesis could be replaced by a ","

or by a ":"   ;-)
Again: it's an explanation, so IMHO the comma would make it a tad less clear. I feel that punctuation can - and should - be used to help 
clarify the relationship between sentences rather than simply separate them. [FL]

Proposed [FL]:

The polarizations of the \Jpsi\ and \Psis\ states, 
as defined in suitable decay frames [19], affect the muon momentum spectra in the laboratory frame. 
This in turn affects the selection acceptance and, as a consequence, 
the extracted cross-sections results.
