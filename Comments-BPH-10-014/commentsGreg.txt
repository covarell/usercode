I have just a handful of physics comments and a number of style suggestions aimed at preserving a uniform style of the paper. Suggested additions or corrections are sometimes CAPITALIZED for clarity.

> 0) My general comment is that Ref. [27] is not a proper way to archive the numerical information for the publication. This must be submitted as a supplement to the paper and kept on the journal Web site, rather than on our Twiki page. Anyone in CMS could modify or delete the Twiki page by accident; thus one can't possibly use Twiki as an archival method. Given that you are not pressed for length at all, I do not understand the rational of not including all the tables in the paper itself (in addition to providing numerical info via journal supplement on their Web site).
  
Sure. This is only a temporary entry and will be changed into the proper
link to the journal web server at submission time (method suggested by
R. Tenchini and used in many other CMS papers).

> 1) Figures 1, 3: the panes with pulls are really illegible - the font is way too small. You waste a lot of real estate by separating the two panes vertically by a huge amount of white space. Suggest combining the two panes (saves you second set of x-axis labels as well!) and showing the pulls with color bars, a la Fig. 2 in our dijet paper, arXiv:1107.4771. This way the figures would look cleaner. You should also make them wider to use the real estate more efficiently.

The pull plots in the mass fits will be removed, since many reviewers do not 
see a need for them. They will be kept for the lifetime plots where Pearson's 
test is less reliable due to small number of entries in the tails. The 
"B" (bar) graph option you suggest is not suitable in ROOT for bins of 
different widths, so we are forced to keep the markers instead.

> 2) L34: The RIGHT-handed; L36: along the COUNTERCLOCKWISE-beam direction.

All the sentence has been rephrased.

  3) L87: why the muons is allowed to pass as far as +/-30 cm in z from the primary vertex? This doesn't make sense - is this a typo?

A cylinder of 30 cm means +/-15 cm, not 30. Indeed this is a big value, 
reflecting that we are not really applying a cut (this would be risky
because the highly boosted non-prompt J/psi can have a significant flight
path in the z-direction) but just a safety check for misreconstructed 
muons.

> 4) Eq. (1): since the detector and generator pT, y quantities are not the same, how do you account for bin-to-bin migration with this formula? Do you just accept it as is (which means that some acceptances could in principle exceed 1)? If so, it's worth mentioning in the text and also use p_T^det, y^det and p_T^gen, y^gen, to distinguish from one the other.

This effect is included in the pT smearing technique (see "pT calibration"
systematics description). 

> 5) Eq. (3): the last two \lambda terms need to be explained, particularly if you use them in definition of the four polarization models.

They are not used. They are always fixed to 0 in the extreme polarization 
scenarios (only \lambda_theta is changed to extreme values). Added short
description.

>  6) LL170-172: the sentence is confusing, as the "default" choice is not clear. From the previous text, it appears that you use EvtGen as the default choice. Also, why the systematic uncertainty evaluated for e+e- production applies to the pp production, where the ratio of prompt and non-prompt mesons is very different?
 
The Babar measurement is for 100% non-prompt events, since the 
reconstruction of a B-meson is required in their analysis. And this is 
in fact used only for the non-prompt component. Explanation improved.

> 7) LL262 and 269: why do you use different J/psi sidebands for the two fitting methods? They are different only by 50 MeV, so what's the point of not making them the same. This is particularly true given that you assign systematics on the sidebands method using twice as big variation of 100 MeV - sounds like the 50 MeV difference is in the noise and should not be there to start with.

They are the same. Typo. Second one removed now.

  8) L386: what is meant here by "b-fractions" (should be b fractions, with no hyphen!)? This sounds too close to "branching fractions", so please rephrase more clearly.

b-fractions = non-prompt fractions. We will use this second notation.
 
> STYLE COMMENTS:
> 
> Also, since you do not hyphenate other compounds containing particle names, you should not hyphenate "b hadron". Finally, it would be logical if you pick "b hadron" to call the prompt decay fraction fb, not fB.

hyphen kept when "b-hadron" is an attribute, as in "b-hadron decays"

> 
> 1) Abstract, LL2-3: at the LHC WITH the data SAMPLE CORRESPONDING to;

Sentence break kept. "sample" added.

> L6: null -> zero; 

this did not trouble other reviewers, kept.

> L8: between -> for.

changed to "ratio between the differential cross sections for the two states"

> 
> L156: to separately PASS L1 single-muon TRIGGER. 

"fire" changed to PASS

>L4 below Eq. (2): cross section (no hyphen); 

we keep the hyphen when it is an attribute. Probably here it is not, strictly speaking. The opinion of an authority is needed :)
(Why no hyphen here, and a hyphen in the  title of subsection 5.1?)

>next line: begs a citation for the helicity and Collins-Soper frames;

The definitions are complex and given in the reference.

> L183: add a comma before "which"

"which" does not always need to be preceded by a comma; actually sometimes the comma is wrong.

>;  \rho-factor; delete (defined by Eq. 5" as you are explaining variables in that very equation in this whole paragraph. 

We have been asked to explain what "factorization" means, so we still feel we have to point out that rho is defined by the equation.
 

> rapidity-; L200: pT-bin;

many different suggestions here... the form (y,pt), that had been used elsewhere, has  been corrected to "y AND pt"... Not clear which is the best.


> Eq. (6): end with a comma; LL201-202: the clause "using the "fine-grained" bins of the acceptance" is completely useless, as it doesn't explain at all what's meant by the fine-grained, which is mysteriously put in quotation marks - delete it, as it doesn't provide any information. 

The acceptance and the efficiency have been computed in bins of much smaller 
size than those used for the cross(-)section determination, to minimize 
spectrum-shape effects and this is stated at the beginning of the section.
We think it is relevant to recall this, for equation (6) would otherwise make 
no sense at all (no averaging would be needed). 

>L206: errors -> uncertainties;

it's just to avoid repetition...

>  L260: CONVOLUTED;

"convolved" vs "convoluted" is apparently debated.
(over 135000 google occurrences for "convolved with a Gaussian", as opposed to 47000 occurrences for "convoluted with a Gaussian")

>  L271: Shows TWO REPRESENTATIVE FITS TO THE J/\psi and \psi(2S);

changed according to FNAL's suggestion


> L276: in Ref. [4] and add a comma after [4];

this is one of the cases where the commas would be wrong since the 
would change the logical meaning of the sentence.

> L284: end with a colon; 

Opposite comment by other reviewers.

> L316: theoretical UNCERTAINTIES;

It's repeated too many times. Everyone knows that "errors" is not strictly correct, but we think it can be used as as synonym when there is no ambiguity and when it can avoid ugly repetitions.


> L317: add a citation to the fit determination from the Tevatron data; L318: theoretical UNCERTAINTIES include THE CHOICE OF THE renormalization and factorization SCALES; quark MASSES; 

Plurals corrected. "Errors" kept for the reasons stated above.
