> Congratulations on the new result on the charmonium production cross section and a well-written paper. I have just a handful of physics comments and a number of style suggestions aimed at preserving a uniform style of the paper. Suggested additions or corrections are sometimes CAPITALIZED for clarity.

> 0) My general comment is that Ref. [27] is not a proper way to archive the numerical information for the publication. This must be submitted as a supplement to the paper and kept on the journal Web site, rather than on our Twiki page. Anyone in CMS could modify or delete the Twiki page by accident; thus one can't possibly use Twiki as an archival method. Given that you are not pressed for length at all, I do not understand the rational of not including all the tables in the paper itself (in addition to providing numerical info via journal supplement on their Web site).
  
Sure. This is only a temporary entry and will be changed into the proper
link to the journal web server at submission time (method suggested by
R. Tenchini and used in many other CMS papers).

> 1) Figures 1, 3: the panes with pulls are really illegible - the font is way too small. You waste a lot of real estate by separating the two panes vertically by a huge amount of white space. Suggest combining the two panes (saves you second set of x-axis labels as well!) and showing the pulls with color bars, a la Fig. 2 in our dijet paper, arXiv:1107.4771. This way the figures would look cleaner. You should also make them wider to use the real estate more efficiently.

The pull plots will be removed, since many reviewers do not see a need for
them. Also, the fact that proper pull distributions are obtained in 
mass-lifetime plots was already shown in the first J/psi paper. They will
be kept for the lifetime plots where Pearson's test is less reliable due
to small number of entries in the tails. The "B" (bar) option in ROOT is
not optimized for bins of different widths, so we are forced to keep the
markers instead.

> 2) L34: The RIGHT-handed; L36: along the COUNTERCLOCKWISE-beam direction.

Ok.

  3) L87: why the muons is allowed to pass as far as +/-30 cm in z from the primary vertex? This doesn't make sense - is this a typo?

A cylinder of 30 cm means +/-15 cm, not 30. Indeed this is a big value, 
reflecting that we are not really applying a cut (this would be risky
because the highly boosted non-prompt J/psi can have a significant flight
path in the z-direction) but just a safety check for misreconstructed 
muons.

> 4) Eq. (1): since the detector and generator pT, y quantities are not the same, how do you account for bin-to-bin migration with this formula? Do you just accept it as is (which means that some acceptances could in principle exceed 1)? If so, it's worth mentioning in the text and also use p_T^det, y^det and p_T^gen, y^gen, to distinguish from one the other.

This effect is included in the pT smearing technique (see "pT calibration"
systematics description). 

> 5) Eq. (3): the last two \lambda terms need to be explained, particularly if you use them in definition of the four polarization models.

They are not used. They are always fixed to 0 in the extreme polarization 
scenarios (only \lambda_theta is changed to extreme values).

>  6) LL170-172: the sentence is confusing, as the "default" choice is not clear. From the previous text, it appears that you use EvtGen as the default choice. Also, why the systematic uncertainty evaluated for e+e- production applies to the pp production, where the ratio of prompt and non-prompt mesons is very different?
 
The Babar measurement is for 100% non-prompt events, since the 
reconstruction of a B-meson is required in their analysis. And this is 
in fact used only for the non-prompt component. We will clarify this in 
the paper. 

> 7) LL262 and 269: why do you use different J/psi sidebands for the two fitting methods? They are different only by 50 MeV, so what's the point of not making them the same. This is particularly true given that you assign systematics on the sidebands method using twice as big variation of 100 MeV - sounds like the 50 MeV difference is in the noise and should not be there to start with.

They are the same. Typo.

  8) L386: what is meant here by "b-fractions" (should be b fractions, with no hyphen!)? This sounds too close to "branching fractions", so please rephrase more clearly.

b-fractions = non-prompt fractions. We will use this second notation.
 
> STYLE COMMENTS:
> 
> 0) General: the paper uses mixed notations for various MC codes. The CMS Style calls for typesetting them all in small caps, i.e. {\sc EvtGen}, {\sc Pythia}, etc. When citing a particular reference, the construct "in [xx]" is grammatically incomplete; please use "in Ref. [xx]" instead - there are really many places, where this change is needed, so please use context search-and-replace to fix those. The paper mixes "branching ratio" and "branching fraction" notations; please use the latter as the proper term (also used in majority of our other publications). You mix "B hadron", "b hadron", and "b-hadron" through the paper. Please, decide whether you want to capitalize the B or not. Also, since you do not hyphenate other compounds containing particle names, you should not hyphenate "b hadron". Finally, it would be logical if you pick "b hadron" to call the prompt decay fraction fb, not fB.
