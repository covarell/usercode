Hello Ian,

thanks once more for the careful scrutiny of the paper.

Our answers follow. In the "English/Trivia" section, comments not replied to 
are accepted for the new version of the paper.

  *       L23: This says that you present your results into different ways: 
with and without the acceptance corrections.  However, I don't see these two 
sets of results in the rest of the paper.  Please make it much clearer which 
of the two methods you're using, when you present your results.

*** ROBERTO *** Ci mettiamo le figure senza accettanza?

> *       L12: You say "These models".  Please clarify which models are 
you referring to?  Are you only referring to the NRQCD models, or to 
all models?

Changed "These..." to "However, NRQCD..."

> *       L187-8: Shouldn't we add that the efficiency is measured only for 
particles within the geometric acceptance?

It will be added.

> *       L189-192: Replace "a stronger" -->" the strongest"?  And "and are 
then" -->", so are".  Your paragraph suggests that you do not bin the 
tracking efficiency at all.  Is this true? 

No, simply the bins are larger. We will make it clearer.

> Your paragraph also says nothing about the binning of epsilon_{off|ID}.

L189 "The muon identification and trigger efficiencies..." refers to 
epsilon_{ID|track}, epsilon_{off|ID} and epsilon_{trig|off}: tt will be 
explained better.

> *       L198: "few bins" -->" few bins at high pT".

Ok. 

> *       L199-204: I suggest moving this paragraph to after L214.  It 
discusses how you combine and acceptance and efficiency, so it should 
conclude this subsection.  

This is not possible, because the muon efficiency uncertainty is propagated 
to the cross-section through the <1/A * eff> factor determination in the
toy experiments. So this factor must be defined before discussing the
systematics.

> You might also consider moving L221-2, which explains that you also use equation 6 without the acceptance a factor for some results, to the end of this paragraph.

Agreed.

> *       L210: What is a "split-gaussian"?

A Gaussian where the widths on the left and right side of the MPV are not the
same (with a proper normalization factor).

> *       L232-3: Do you really take the primary vertex which is closest in Z 
to the J/psi vertex?  I.e.  If the J/psi vertex is non-prompt, you do not 
bother taking into account its reconstructed flight path when choosing the 
primary vertex ?

This is a good question. In fact, in presence of significant pileup, this
requirement should be changed to: the primary vertex that gives the smallest
pointing angle (i.e. the angle between the J/psi momentum vector
and the reconstructed flight path in the hypothesis of that PV).
With the very small pile-up of 2010 data, this was found to be sufficient.

> *       Tables 1 & 2: Since the text refers to these two figures after it refers to figures 4 & 5, please move table 1 after these figures in the paper.  

Ok.

> If possible, I suggest that you put both tables 1 & 2 on the same page, presumably a page with no other text on it.

We will try.

> *       Table 3: I remain surprised by how small your systematic errors due to the rho factor are.  Fig. 15 C of the AN-NOTE suggests that this systematic error can be as large as ~20%, not only in the 0-0.9 rapidity bin, but also in the 0.9-1.2 and 1.2-1.6 bins.

Not in the region where we give results. You can see from the final tables and 
figures that the bin 45 < pT < 70 GeV/c is only considered for |y| < 0.9 (due
to lack of statistics in real data for the other bins).
 
> *       Fig. 4a: This looks like identical to Fig. 5a !  Have you accidentally linked to the wrong figure???

Yes, sorry. The next version will contain the correct one, for now please 
refer to the corresponding figure in the PAS (which is correct).

  *       Sect. 7.4: This now looks much more solid.  However, I am surprised 
at how small the theoretical error is (2%).  Since you measure the cross 
section ratio only for Pt > 5.5 GeV, you are measuring only about 20% 
(I guess) of the total cross-section. So you are assuming that you can 
extrapolate down to Pt = 0 GeV, so picking up this missing 80% with only a 2% 
theoretical error. I do accept your argument that many of the theoretical 
uncertainties will cancel in the ratio. But nonetheless I am surprised. But 
I am not qualified to judge these theoretical calculations, so only ask you 
to check.

Yes, we checked this with M. Cacciari (author of the FONLL predictions) who
also gave us the minimum and maximum value of the ratio prediction on which
we base the theoretical uncertainty. See also the approval slides.

> *       In general, the quality of the English in the paper is good.  However it is not quite perfect.  Therefore, after you have released the next draft taking into account the comments made during the CWR, someone (e.g Carlos Lourenco or me) should go through it carefully, and send you these minor corrections.

Sure, thanks. As you can see we received substantive comments during the 
CWR phase, so we suggest you to wait for the next draft.

> *       Everywhere: Are you using the correct latex symbol for "J/psi"?  The spaces on either side of the slash look too large to me.

We will check this. I'm afraid that, since CMS uses a font so different from
those used in most papers, there is no symbol which appears nice at the
same time in CMS and paper styles. We will try a few more options, though.

So if we go for 1) it will look nice in CMS and ugly in the paper, if we go 
for 2) it will be the opposite.

Ok.
