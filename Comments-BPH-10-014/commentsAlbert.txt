You're welcome!

Our answers follow. In the "Details" section, comments not replied to 
are accepted for the new version of the paper.

The effect of the triggers is to reduce the low-pT reach of the measurements.
On the other hand, the high pT reach is increased due to higher statistics.
We included Fig. 2 exactly to show these effects.

Pile-up does not affect the dimuon mass, which is anyway "cleaned" by the
tighter trigger requirements". Effects on the choice of the PV for the 
lifetime measurements are detailed in the "pile-up" systematics.

We can expand on both subjects in the paper.

The discussion on the acceptance/polarization is indeed a bit split up, as
noticed also by other reviewers. We will improve on that.

Both are complex models, taking into account several effects which are hard
to summarize in a few lines. We will try to add more information.

The way to show numerical results was actually a suggestion of his. Notice 
that the Twiki and the reference to it are temporary: at submission time, all
the material will be placed in the appropriate areas of the journal webserver.

Do you mean chi_cJ? It is a standard way to refer to the three resonances
chi_c0, chi_c1, chi_c2 using the total spin index. chi_c only may be also a
good choice.
 
> line 13-14: what did we learn at the end in this paper related to the questions posed here?

As noticed by other reviewers, this sentence is too strong and will be 
changed. The result of our paper is that psi' production agrees with NLO
NRQCD within the (quite large) theory errors.

Ok.

Well, yes. In Pythia both color-singlet and color octet states are simulated
as 'particles' with some status. However color-singlet particles are already
physical states (either J/psi or eventually decaying into it), while 
color-octets are unphysical, so showering must be always turned on to obtain
a sensible event.

The amount of FSR changes the acceptance, since when this effect is larger 
the muon pT decreases on average and so does the acceptance.
To account for the fact that this amount of FSR is taken from a MC simulation
(PHOTOS) we take as alternative the acceptance wuth PHOTOS switched off and
assign as a systematic uncertainty the difference with the default setting.

> line 189: "¡Ä have a stronger pT and eta dependence". Stronger than what?

Changed into "the strongest".

> line 224: do we say somewhere in the paper that ref [4] was for much lower luminosity?

No, we can add it in the introduction or in the inclusive cross-section part.

Ok, we will do that.

Just to guide the eye: if you try to imagine the figure without the lines, it's
very hard to follow the pattern of one rapidity bin, because the cross-sections
decrease very rapidly with pT (this is true especially for J/psi).

Yes, sorry. The next version will contain the correct one, for now please 
refer to the corresponding figure in the PAS (which is correct).

> Fig 6: what errors are included for the data points? Statistical only?

No, statistics + all systematics except luminosity and polarization, as 
specified in the figure.

Also this statement will be softened, because the effect is not so 
significant and there are many factors (e.g. model for b fragmentation into
B and then J/psi) that could affect the spectra even if the FONLL at parton
level is correct.

> line 391: in the text we say a factor 3.5, here 3. Be consistent...

Ok.
