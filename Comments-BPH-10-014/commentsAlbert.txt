> Section 7.2 is strange: just telling that these numbers exist without showing or discussing them. If these are interesting we should discuss them here,otherwise this section should be part of some other part of the text.

> More importantly: it looks like fig 4a and 5a are identical in the paper (both are for FONLL)
> Is the NRQCD figure missing? difficult to check the physics discussion in the paper, with this wrong figure…
