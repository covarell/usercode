DATASETS

The input to the fitting macros must be a RooDataSet with the proper variable
names. If you use the official analyzer 
HeavyFlavorAnalysis/Onia2MuMu/src/JpsiAnalyzerPAT.cc
this is already the correct output format.

TTREES

If you are starting from TTrees instead, please do:
> make TreeToDat
> TreeToDat <rootFileContainingTheTree.root>
The default is to produce several datasets divided in rapidity regions, and
with two RooDataSets, in the J/psi and psi' mass regions respectively. Edit 
the tree_to_datasets.cxx macro to simplify the output.

MONTECARLO

If you are running on MC, not real data, there is a special procedure to 
previously merge the samples.
Out of the n AnalyzerPAT jobs, you get n RooDataSets, one for signal prompt, 
some for non-prompt, one for ppMuMu etc.
[N.B. In order to avoid double-counting of J/psi events in background you 
must set removeSignalEvents = true when processing backgrounds!]
First you need to merge them in one:
- go into the HeavyFlavorAnalysis/Onia2MuMu/test directory
- edit MergeDataSets.C, as to have the proper weights
- prepare a file list (simple text file with the names of the n RooDataSets, 
one per line, in the same order as the weights)
- make MergeDataSets
- MergeDataSets <your file list>
and you obtain the resulting merged RooDataSet totalDataSet.root

THE MASS FIT

You can do it for in a single pt/y bin using fitMass_ranges.cxx.
- cmsenv
- make FitMassRange
- FitMassRange <options>
Options can be found in the main() method of the classes. Briefly:
  -f <your total RooDataSet>: input file is always needed
  -p <pTrange>: must be in the format pTmin-pTmax
  -e <absyrange>: must be in the format absymin-absymax
  -c : activates prefitting of signal only to determine signal shape in advance
  -s : activates prefitting of sidebands only to determine background shape in advance 

THE 2D FIT

You can do it for the J/psi in a single pt/y bin using fit2D_ranges.cxx (MC)
or fit2DData_ranges.cxx (data).
- check that the directory ../../../../../lib/ exists (it should be the case
if you correctly installed JpsiMacros in a CMSSW directory, otherwise change
the target directory in the MakeFile)
- cmsenv
- make RooHistPdfConv.o
- make Fit2D[Data]Range
- Fit2D[Data]Range <options>
Options can be found in the main() method of the classes. Briefly:
  -f <your total RooDataSet>: input file is always needed
  -p <pTrange>: must be in the format pTmin-pTmax
  -e <absyrange>: must be in the format absymin-absymax
  -l <lrange>: range of decay length (always needed). Notice the special format:     
     lmin-lmax means the fit is performed between MINUS lmin and lmax, e.g.:
     -l 1.0-2.0 means between -1.0 and 2.0 mm
  -g 0 (global-tracker muon pairs) or 1 (global-global muon pairs) or nothing 
(all muon pairs) 
  -p <pTrange>: must be in the format pTmin-pTmax
  -e <absyrange>: must be in the format absymin-absymax
  -s : activates prefitting of signal only to determine mass signal shape in advance
  -c : activates prefitting of signal only to determine lifetime signal shape in advance
  -b : activates prefitting of sidebands only to determine lifetime background shape in advance (RECOMMENDED) 
  -u : DON'T do an extended maximum likelihood (i.e. determine just the 
fraction of J/psi from B and not NsigPrompt and NsigNonPrompt from the fit) 

If you want to determine lifetime distributions in advance on MC, compile 
and run respectively: FitLifetimePrompt, FitLifetimeNonPrompt, FitLifetimeBkg.

launchManyFits.pl can be used to fit in series different pT-y bins.
