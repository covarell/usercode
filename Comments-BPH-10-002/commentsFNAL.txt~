a) Polarization: handling is confusing. More should be said in the introduction and where
appropriate in the text about lack of theoretical understanding of the Tevatron data and that
variation in these models would produce major differences in the results if these were included in
the simulation.
b) A lot of the systematic errors as given in the tables fluctuate a lot. Have these been checked
carefully or just came out of the program? Is this just due to statistical fluctuation in the
procedure to determine the assigned systematic uncertainty? Should large bin size be used to
avoid these fluctuations and get a more robust evaluation of the uncertainty?
c) Acceptance correction: J/psi generated in bin n which was then found in bin n+1 (or vice
versa). Has resolution effects taken into account when corrected for the acceptance?
d) Global vs Tracker muon: Does the MC gives the same ratio of Global vs Tracker muon as the
data? Is there a difference between the acceptance for the Global and Tracker muon?
e) Luminosity is the single biggest source of systematic uncertainty. There should be some
discussion about this.
f) The systematics are significantly smaller for lambda=-1. Which one of the individual
contributions is affected so much by the polarization? Please mention this in the text.
g) Question on the efficiency calculation: With two muons in the same event, it's easier to fulfill
the trigger requirement. According to eqn 4, the trigger efficiency is calculated as the product of
individual efficiency from the two muons which is not correct.
h) Selecting the right J/psi: on average, there are 1.07 J/psi candidates per selected event. There
is a prescription of how to pick the âcorrect J/psiâ. From Monte Carlo studies, how often this
arbitration (i.e. largest pT) picks the correct candidate?
i) Resolution for prompt and non-prompt J/Psi: Both samples are assumed to have the same
resolution model in decay lifetime. It is possible that they are different. It may be more
appropriate to study the systematic is to use different functional form for the two.
j) Comparison of the prompt J/psi data with model: A statement should be made that none of the
model describe the prompt data.
k) The tables shows results of Pt below 4.5 GeV/c for the rapidity range above 1.2. In fact, for
the rapidity range between 1.6 to 2.4, the Pt coverage goes all the way to 0 GeV/c. Also this is
shown in Fig. 3. However, the cross-section results report only covered the Pt range above 4.5
GeV/c. There was no explanation in the text about this. Looking at figure 5, one can see clear
differences between the various models in the low Pt region. So the data is there but its
discrimination power is not being used. Please explain.
l) Eqn. 4, line#192 there is a correction \rho to the efficiency that takes into account the effects of
bin size and factorization, which is determined from MC to be 0.095 with a (sic) RMS of 0.11
Why is this then not set to 0, with a comment that this correction is negligible?
A couple of paragraphs later, line #205 they are talking about a non-vanishing value for \rho the
variation of which is then is used as an estimate for the systematic error. How does this relates to
the RMS mentioned above?
m) primary vertex estimation, line 306: why would the difference of two methods be a good
estimate for the systematics here? Is this a big effect? There is no indication how important this
is, and if it is a sizable effect, just using a different method and take this as a systematic error is
not a very scientific approach.
n) In the Introduction
"they generally fail to describe simultaneously the cross-section and polarization". My
understanding is that NNLO plus other standard QCD contributions can now account for both the
cross section and the polarization; would suggest that the authors consult with the people listed
in the Acknowledgments.
The paper would emphasize that J/psi production has TWO main divisions: prompt and nonprompt.
Prompt production includes feed-downs from the psi(2S) and chi states, but these have
extremely short lifetimes and do not lead to secondary vertices. In the color octet and
evaporation models there is a similar feed-down mechanism.
