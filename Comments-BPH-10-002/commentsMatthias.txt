Dear Matthias,

thanks for your useful comments.

We will add it in the footnote on page 1.

OK. We will change it.

We can add it, although figure 2 already says it all.

Yes. The choice is clear if you look at the muon acceptance contours in the
Analysis Note (there is no room for adding them as well in the paper).
We could add "The following kinematic cuts, BASED ON EITHER TOTAL OR 
TRANSVERSE MUON MOMENTUM, DEPENDING ON |ETA|, are then chosen etc."

General concern. We will post the final choice in HN, after agreement with
ARC and Phys-Coord.

Just a few words here. In principle no contribution should come from 
the statistical fluctuation of the bin contents, since the systematics are
computed fitting THE SAME data with different conditions: but this is not
strictly true e.g. for the "background fit", as you point out.

Unfortunately, since the lifetime resolution is strongly varying with pT, 
if you try to merge bins to compute the systematics, the fit does not 
converge properly, as the 2-core Gaussian resolution modeling is no more
valid. This will be solved in future developments of this analysis using a
more complicated fit where the constant sigma's for the Gaussian is 
changed to a per-event error computed with vertex covariance matrices: in this
way the dependence is removed and the systematics can be computed on larger
samples. For this analysis, we had no time to fully develop this more
complicated technique and the systematics are simply computed as a maximal
variation of the result bin by bin.
