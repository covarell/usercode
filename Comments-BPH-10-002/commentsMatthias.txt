I have only very few comments:

1) rapidity vs pseudorapidity

-The pseudorapdity is defined, but the rapidity is not. Maybe add the 
definition for y as well?

-line 51: trigger coverage should probably be in pseudorapidity (eta is 
already used)

-The relation between the muons pseudorapidity and the J/Psis rapidity can 
be guessed at from figure 2, but a line of text may be useful too.

2) The acceptance definition above line 133 is somewhat confusing. Is the 
1.3<eta<2.2 line really supposed to cut on p (not pt)?

If different variables are chosen depending on eta bin, maybe there should 
be some motivation in the text for the specific choice of p over pt in the 
intermediate eta region.

3) Systematic uncertainties

Several systematic uncertainties, ("Fit function" in Table 3, most of 
Table 6) appear to vary quite extremely between bins. For example the in 
the 1.2<y<1.6 bin for Table 6, the background fit error changes from 
0.0169 (~10%) at 4.5-6-5 GeV to 0 in the next higher pt bin. Are the 
reasons for this understood? How much of this variation is the result of 
statistical fluctuations between the bins? If the fluctuations are very 
pronounced it may be better to obtain the uncertainties for subsamples 
that integrate over larger kinematic regions.
