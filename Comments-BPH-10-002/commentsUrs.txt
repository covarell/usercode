Dear Urs and PSI team,

thanks for the careful reading of the paper. Our replies follow.

OK.

Right. The sentence should be "... generally fail [6] to describe 
simultaneously ... and the polarization measurements [7-8] ... "

OK.

Correct, but we think the message is clear.

This sentence will be removed (see answers to Teresa/Amnon).

OK. We will change "dpT dy" -> "(dpT dy)"

Ok./Ok./Ok.

There are a few such occurrences. We will try to be uniform.

OK.

OK.

Well, we have to specify that we do not require any pT threshold at L1.
 
> L69: Add 'color' in front of 'singlet'

OK.

Because it is applied. And it is surely very loose, but there are global
muons in data where this value goes up to 100.

It will be put.

No problem.

No, there isn't.

OK.

Right.

Surely can be changed, but this is the approved CMS TDR style.

This seems really a minor detail.

We have verified that, but we can remove the sentence.

Have???

It's not easy to explain because it is obtained as the sum of many decays,
both inclusive and exclusive. We use the prediction of a MC description, 
rather than the error to compare, because the measured value by Babar is
not necessarily the best estimate (Bs and LambdaB contributions are missing).

OK.

OK.

It's 0.165%, not 1.65% (therefore negligible).

OK.

A typo, will correct.

We will remove "internal", so both contributions are included.

OK.

General concern, being discussed in detail with the ARC.

It can be done.

Yes, formatting problem. Will be changed.

OK.

If you don't like ',' or '-', you should tell us which spacer to use...
Clearly we cannot write "CMS sqrt(s) = ..."

The entries are not weighted. The bin size varies over the plot, so 
the bin heights (not entries) are adjusted by RooFit so that bin (width*height)
is proportional to the number of entries.

They are cut by the choice of the minimum of the log scale.

OK. Mixed is not the proper word.
