Dear Anne-Marie, 

thanks for your careful reading. 

All the minor typos have been considered in our paper.
Answers to the non-trivial ones follow.

Maybe not here, too detailed for an abstract.

Since this was not tested, we chose to remove this sentence.
   
> Line 88: Say why this choice is made, ie Global Muons are purer.

OK.
 
> Fig 1: add in the text around line 117 what are the processes contributing 
> to the background ?

It may be added, but it is not really understood. In studies done with 
Minimum Bias MC, not enough events survive to make a quantitative statements,
and using di-muon-enriched QCD, the background turns out to be underestimated
by a factor ~2.

It's not the same quantity. eta is used for muons (which is actually the same
as y, since muons are almost massless), and y for J/psi.
 
> Why 100 MeV particularly -> corresponds to ~2-3 sigma given in fig 1 ?

Yes.
 
> Line 152: dimuon or the J/psi variables -> dimuon or the generator-level 
> J/psi variables

Yes, this sentence will be changed (see answers to Amnon).

See new paper layout, table content has changed significantly.

A leftover. This will be changed.

Yes (see answers to Sijin).

Well, not from kinematics because these cross-section are already
acceptance-corrected. It is the cross-section suppression due to 
soft gluon emission, seen in many other QCD processes.
  
> Line 279: Give functional form?

It is quite complicated and, being empirical, does not add so much information,
but will be added.
 
> Fig 4: add pT and y bin values on plot itself ?

No room for that (actually there are opposite complaints about having too
much information in the plot.)

See above.

Correct.

The comparison paragraph has changed.

OK.

> Why quote doi or arXiv info for published articles?

OK. That will be removed.
