Yes your impression is right and the radiative tail increase in the forward region. In particular in the forward region we are able to reconstruct muons that have lost a considerable amount of energy irradiating photons, these muons populate the low energy tail of the Crystal Ball function. In the barrel region there is an intrinsic pT cut in recostructing muons due to the structure of CMS: the high bending power of the magnetic field and the presence of the magnet and the iron yoke material make possible to recostruct muons with a pT > 3.5 GeV in the barrel. It is then more likely to "lose"  muons that have irradiated a huge amount of energy in photons in the barrel than in the forward, where we can reconstruct muons with a very low pT.

It is the mean pt of events in an invariant mass region of +/- 100 MeV/c^2 around the J/psi peak value

> There is a preponderance of results in the list of references, namely 14, 15, 23, 25 and 29 that have not been considered worthy of a proper publication by CMS and hence have not been peer reviewed. Yet several analysis aspects for this report are directly drawn from the notes with little further explanation. Reference [23] is based on much smaller statistics than this paper and yet drives the systematic uncertainty. The analysis introduces formally a correlation rho, which seems to be driven by a binning artifact rather than adequate analysis of the full data. This is one example where it would be much preferable to see the relevant assessment of the data carried out for and in the publication.
