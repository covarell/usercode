- Equation 1 (right before line 100): 
  the function used is actually the following: 
  p_{T}^{corr}=(1+a_{1}+a_{2}$\eta^{2}$)p_{T}
  (the values for a_{1} and a_{2} in Table 1 are correct),
  where $p_{T}$ is the measured muon transverse momentum and
  $p_{T}^{corr}$ is the corrected transverse momentum. 

- lines 166-169 (from "As a conservative" to the end of the
  paragraph):
  The method used is not exactly the one described here. I would
  replace it with something like this (English to be reviewed...): 
  "As a conservative estimate of the systematic uncertainty, the 
  acceptance has been recomputed in the two maximally biased cases:
  adding the maximum residual shift to the momenta of all simulated
  muons, or subtracting it. The relative difference between these
  values is taken as the systematic uncertainty."
