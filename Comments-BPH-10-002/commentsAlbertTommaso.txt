Can you give more information about calculations made by the Durham group? 
We have informed with several MC experts, but nobody had any knowledge of 
calculations made by that group (I confess that I didn't contact that group 
directly). Even though it's too late to include it, it would still be good 
to know about these calculations. The reason why we mention NRQCD and the 
CSM is that these are the most well-known models, and people will certainly 
wonder why we do not compare them, probably much more than any other model. 
In any case, we will modify the text and add some more information about 
the models compared.

This is a good question. The uncertainty can in principle be determined 
for example by changing several parameters in the even generation. This has 
been done for PYTHIA in the past and was shown in CMS AN-2007/042 in section 
3.3. The order of magnitude of uncertainty was, very roughly, of the order
 of a factor 3. The same is estimated for CASCADE and CEM by the authors, but
 to confirm it, Hannes Jung and Ramona Vogt would have to do a significant 
amount of work and change several parameters and rerun many times. Not only
 this would take a significant amount of time, the final error band will 
still be just an estimate. In any case, it's true that these models do have 
uncertainties, and that the order is probably about a factor 3. We will add 
a phrase to the text.

That's hard to say, we'll leave this to the readers of the paper. The more
marked departure (rapid decrease at high pT) requires more statistics and
finer binning before some solid conclusion can be drawn.

For the moment, since the two sets of theories (prompt and non-prompt 
production) use somehow independent calculation techniques, we cannot tell
exactly if the b-fraction being constant with sqrt(s) is expected or is
merely incidental, so we chose not to include this figure. Surely the
comparison between the 4 experiments at LHC, once all results are available,
will be a nice picture to show around.

This sentence is now removed.

This concern was also expressed by FNAL people. Please see the answer to
them.
