You're welcome.

Using larger fonts means suppressing some of the information contained 
there, which was required by the coordination to make plots self-explanatory
for conference presentation. Which ones should we suppress (if any)?

This is already in lines 68-74. Should we repeat it here?

No. N_det is not the number of selected J/psi events, it's the number of
J/psi that can in principle be detected because both muons lie in the 
acceptance (before any analysis cut).

We can move this information before. *not done*

Yes. We can remove "unphysical" and re-arrange the two paragraphs. *partially done*

Fig. 2 gives the reader the only information of where the acceptance is and 
where the data are distributed. We believe is important.

This is already in lines 68-74. We should not repeat here.

In the last case (EvtGen vs. Babar measurement).

OK *done*.

OK. *done*

OK. *done*

Yes. Thanks for spotting this. *done*

No. Here we quote only two "figures" but the rho vary from one bin to another 
and they are statistically very accurate. The large value of the RMS is 
actually an indication that in some bins rho is not consistent with zero 
(especially in the forward region, see Analysis Note). That's why we need to 
apply the correction.

I don't understand this comment.

Correct. We will do that.

The table seems quite clear to us. Where is the difficulty in "reading" it?
It will be re-formatted anyway by the Journal (EPJ-C).

This is LaTeX, but we will try to do.

In the original version, the table was put sideways. We need to see the final
page layout to know if this must be done. Same comment above applies.

OK.

No, it is not correct. We should also put \lambda_\phi = 0 (actually in 
all), but it's intended to be like that.

We prefer to leave that line.

We will follow this suggestion.

OK.

OK.

We will change it to l_J/psi, as previously defined.

This is not completely true because at this stage different factors enter
the beam-spot and primary vertex estimation. The beam spot, as you say,
gives a worst estimation because of averaging many events. On the other hand,
the primary vertex can suffer from other uncertainties as misassignment due
to pile-up, bias due to the displacement of tracks in bbbar events, etc.
Those were not studied in detail due to the limited amount of statistics:
so we're not able at this stage to tell which of the two methods gives the
worse resolution (resolution parameter results of the two fits are actually
compatible within errors).

OK.

OK.

See answer to table 4.

Because we're integrating over the full rapidity range and we can only do that
in the pT bins which are in acceptance for all |y| sub-ranges, i.e. only
the last three bins.

OK.
