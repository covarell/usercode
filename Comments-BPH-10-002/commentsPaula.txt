Fine.

Well, of course, we will add Jpsi.

OK.

We said at lines 48-51; presumably the JINST CMS detector paper is a good 
reference.

We can remove the expression "ad-hoc filters".

OK.

Whatever the QCD factors of higher-order effects are, double J/psi
detection is suppressed at least by a factor <A*eff>*BR(J/psi -> mu mu)
~ 0.002. So, using inclusive muons as we do in the analysis (also tracker 
muons), the fraction of non-genuine low-purity dimuon combination is already
larger than that. Therefore, we consider the double J/psi production
contribution as negligible and remove the double candidates in the events.

Same as above. Additionally in our MC there is no more than 1 Jpsi 
per event.

See answer to Carlos.

OK.

That is not strictly true, since our pt-y bins are large, hence a residual 
effect due to the different shape of the Jpsi pt-y spectrum in that 
particular bin. Moreover, it might be that the different surrounding 
environment of the Jpsi in prompt and non-prompt decays may lead to 
differences. (*)

We discussed about it and decided not to describe in details, but rather 
to give the reader a reference, in order to keep the paper compact.

No, we have two sources: one is coming from the pure statistical error from 
the data T&P efficiency. The other one is coming from the fact that the T&P 
is biasing the true MC efficiency (even in the MC), and we correct for it. So 
we assign an error to that, which is the full difference wrt the true MC and 
the T&P bias. Actually, the dominant by far is the first one, the second one is always
smaller than 1% (relative).

>Table 3: Add in the table caption: ?In addition, the relative error on  
>the luminosity determination is 11%, and is common to all bins.?

We can add that. 

>lines 269-270: it looks strange that you take the ?outliers? from MC,

>Why can?t you take these from data?

The fraction of outliers is very small (varying with the bin, but typically 
<1%) and we have ~1K events per bin; moreover, in the data it's convoluted
with the long tails of the non-prompt and background components. 
So the fit is not able to measure the width and fraction at the same time, 
and we have to fix some of them to prompt MC. Conservatively, in the 
systematics we take the full difference with f_out = 0 (i.e. 2 Gaussians
only).

> line 291: rephrase ?poorly constrained? into ?requires more

No. The 'weak modes' are those which are virtually chi2-invariant
for the alignment and cannot be corrected even with infinite statistics.

>lines 308-309: different efficiencies ? are these due to the lifetime?  
>Explain.

See answer marked with a (*) above. The effect with a floating B-fraction
can be computed analytically and for a difference Deltaeff between eff_prompt
and eff_nonprompt. See:

http://cmsdoc.cern.ch/~covarell/Jpsinote/BfracSyst.pdf

which corresponds to the numbers in the table.

OK.

Yes, the point has been corrected already. 
See answer to Carlos for the |y| < 2.4 plot.
