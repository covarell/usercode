Fine.

Well, of course, we will add Jpsi

We said at lines 48-51; presumably the JINST CMS detector paper is a good reference

There is a reference in there ...

yes. True

I don't think that we will get many; however, the non-genuine dimuon combinations is larger, that is the reason to suppress it.

Yes, in our MC there are not more than 1 Jpsi per event

See answer to Carlos.

Yes

That is not strictly true, since our pt-y bins are large, hence a residual effect due to the different shape of the Jpsi pt-y in that bin. Moreover, it might be that the different surrounding environment of the Jpsi in prompt and non-prompt decays may lead to differences.

We though about it and decided not to describe in details, but rather to give the reader a reference.

No, we have two sources: one is coming from the pure statistical error from the data T&P efficiency. The other one is coming from the fact that the T&P is biassing the true MC efficiency (even in the MC), and we correct for it. So we assign an error to that, which is the full difference wrt the true MC and the T&P bias.
