> I have a few comments on the text, which I list below:
> 
> line 93 : for non-expert it is difficult to understand, how this cylinder

> line 131: does this have any effect on the bin-to-bin correction ?
> line 161: why a variation of 20% ?
> line 322: But MC predictions are also theoretical predictions
> line 339 ff: I guess it would be good to say a bit more what is included 
> in the models. One needs to know, that CASCADE uses uPDF and only the CSM.
> It would be also good to know, which type of CO MEs are included in PYTHIA.
> One should also say, which PDFs were used for the calcs.
> The reference to CASCADE should include the new paper release (see below)
> 
> Fig 6ff: more a question to me¡Ä.. shouldn't we have CASCADE with higher 
> statistics to avoid the wiggles ?
> 
> Ref 34: should include the new reference, which is accepted for pub in EPJC
