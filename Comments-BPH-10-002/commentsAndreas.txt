> Dear Editors and Analysis Team!

> Congratulations on this nice measurement! The analysis appears sound and 
> corrent to us and the paper is already very well written
> 
> Our single most important general comment is the following:
> 
> We have the impression that some of the uncertainties quoted are dominated 
> by the lack of statistics, leading to bin-to-bin fluctuations of the size 
> of the systematic errors. The effect seems to be most apparent in tables 3 
> and 6. With the small data sample at hand, those fluctuations may be largely 
> unavoidable.
> 
> However, given the qualitative character of the present measurement, 
> we question the need for the many detailed listings of acceptance and numbers 
> in tables.
> 
> We think the paper would overall profit, if tables 1, 2, 3, 5 were removed. 
> The relevant information from these tables could (and should) be given 
> in the text.
> 
> Apart from this main comment, we have only few small comments as listed below.
> 
> We wish you good look for the remaining steps towards the final publication!
