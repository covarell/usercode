No problem, but we don't know if that would mess up CDS information etc.

Since we present the result as "Total cross section [...] times the dimuon
branching fraction", that should be clear.

OK, we can move here lines 140-147, with a bit of rephrasing.

OK.

See above.

I don't know which is the convention for EPJ-C. It can certianly be done.

>     * Use references to the tables in the text everywhere.

It seems to us that all Tables are referenced:
Table 1: line 103
Table 2: line 226
Table 3: line 239
Table 4: line 241
Table 5: line 287
Table 6: line 316
Table 7 and 8: line 319

True, but (see answers to other reviewers) this comes from a compromise about
putting as much information as possible inside the figure. This was explicitly
requested by Phys-Coord in order to make figures self-explanatory for future
conference presentations.

As before, we were told not to worry about b/w compatibility.

We don't understand which assumption you are referring to. 
The average/RMS is done on the histogram of the observed (reconstructed) pT 
spectrum.

Thanks. We will add/change the references.

OK.

Do you mean "processing -> filtering"? 
This sentence will be changed (see answers to Teresa) by mentioning explicitly
that there is no HLT request.

OK.

OK.

Which one? Can you say "Corrections for the efficiencies" in English?

OK.

OK.

Yes (so there is no need to specify a third fraction, since the three add up
to 100%).

OK.

OK.

OK (see above). So this part will become shorter.

Correct.

There is no "on" at line 164.

This construction was suggested by a native English speaker:

last comment.

The efficiencies inside a bin of finite size are estimated by a single 
efficiency value, obtained as an average over pT-|eta| inside that bin.
So it is dependent on the distribution of pT-|eta| of the muons inside the 
bin. While tag-and-probe should give ideally the exact efficiency in a
pointlike bin, this is not true anymore for finite bins, since the pT-|eta|
distributions of the "probes" (after requiring a "tag" with strict cuts)
are not identical to those of the muons used to build J/psi candidates,
hence the rho factor. See AN for a broader discussion of the effect.

We were asked by the conveners to add this sentence. Since it only adds a lot
of confusion, it will be removed.

See answers to Ian. Not just numerical issues but also a different
hypothesis on the B-fraction in the two cases.

>     * 334: We dont understand the statement ".. is likely to depend on pt."

Since the non-direct J/psi could have a different pt spectrum than the 
direct ones, the contribution of the feed-down is variable over the pT range.
