The acceptance is the single largest correction you apply (per bin). Yet,
there are no figures, tables or references addressing the overall
quality of the MC ("tune the selection", "check the agreement" are not statements).

I see the agreement is not perfect which is probably attributed to different polarizations
(or?). The paragraph starting at line 197 (about rho) is somewhat also related to
the acceptance (and anyway from this paper it is not clear how adequate are the
"different MC models" in covering the systematic effects mentioned).
If we exclude the rho (which is clearly separated from the acceptance in the paper)
and the polarization (problem) you claim that FSR, resolution, momentum scale, IP
and B-fraction are the main systematic sources. Then by "tuning" them you
should be able to show relatively good data/MC agreement (eventually + efficiency corrections)
which I don't see. Or do you say the deviations in the plot above (upto 30-40%) are covered
by the systematics mentioned (by which part predominantly?)? If the polarization is the problem
how do you prove/check/cross-check it?

Line 112: "1.07 J/Psi". What is the number in MC? Is this pure combinatorics or real
double J/Psi dominate? Does this number have deeper meaning (just curious)?

You don't say it explicitly but you estimate the double muon trigger efficiency by parameterizing
it with the single muon trigger efficiency. This is an assumption (as good as it may be). Did you
check it (from non-muon triggered datasets?)?

Line 213: "a fit". You are giving the main results in this section. What kind of fit? What was
the quality, goodness-of-fit tests?
