Actually, the acceptance is computed in fine grained bins of the pt-|y| of the Jpsi and sampled in the 
actual (in data) Jpsi pt-|y| of each single event, so any particular "feature" which has a residual
dependence from the exact MC generator should be taken out. In other words we do not rely on the MC
except for the geometric acceptance in a small bin in the kinematic variables of the Jpsi which in fact
depends only on the polarization. This is shown in the AN Section 4.1. 

For the rho we compute the systematic by reweightin the Pythia to the other MC models and take the largest difference.

Finally, in the data we just take the T&P efficiency. The only thing to be sure is that the shape of the MC
within the given muon-pt/eta bin is not terribly different between MC and data. For instance if you wish to compute the correlation of the DoubleMuOpenLoose trigger by using a MC which is using the DoubleMuOpen_Tight (as was done at the ICHEP times) that will give totally different (and wrong) values of the correlation.

In fact rho is "taking care" of the goodness of the assumption

In the AN there is the total set of fits with the chi^2
