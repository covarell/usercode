> 1) You use the unphysical, null polarization scenario as the default when quoting efficiencies (e.g., Fig. 2, Table 2). Is it really a common thing to do? Why no chose one of more realistic scenarios, e.g. left or right helicity?

That was agreed among the different experiments and the theory. In fact the helicity depends on the pT of the J/Psi, so one should use a model.The fully transverse assumption you mention is as good as the other 
ones, since at present theory calculation do not really agree with the
measured ones. This is why we choose to give the result in 5 scenarios and
take, let's say, the "average" one (lambda_theta = 0)

> 2) LL111-113: given that on average as many as 7% of the events has more than one J/psi, what's the rational of choosing the one with the largest p_T? This does bias your differential cross section measurement toward higher p_T's. Should not you use all the combinations instead of one per event?

See answers to Anne-Marie. The purity criterion comes before the pT 
criterion, which is only used in a minimal fraction of events (<< 7%).
 

> 3) P5, unnumbered lines at the top: since the muon detectability depends mostly on p, not p_T, what's the rational of making rapidity-dependent p_T cuts, instead of a single cut on the momentum ~4 GeV?

The contour of the muon acceptance is easily seen from the plots of fig. 3 in AN-10-138. It is a lot easier to choose what we have used instead of a p dependent contour in the barrel.

> 4) L167: you call the effect "negligible"; yet you quote per mil effects numerically in other bullets; I am surprised that the effect of the primary vertex position on the acceptance has such a small effect. Is it really below per mil?

Yes, it is


> STYLE COMMENTS:
> 
> 0) General: the paper uses a mixture of tenses and styles, which is not really warranted. The abstract is written in active voice ("We present ..."), contrary to the CMS style recommendations. Most of the paper follows passive voice, but in some cases you switch to the active one (e.g., L207: "Hence we reweighted ..."), which should be avoided. Finally, there are at least three tenses used: present (e.g., L54, "J/psi's are reconstructed ..."), past (L68, "Simulated events were used..."), and past perfect (L101, "has then been performed..."). Please, use one (present) or at most two (present and past) tenses.

We have now tried to homogenize the style and we hope it reads now better.

OK
> L8: pT differential cross section -> differential cross section in pT; L11: remove "and".
OK
> In general abstract is really long. You can shorten it by removing the cross section number and compressing first two sentences in a a single shorter one (sufficient to quote the luminosity, no need to say "collected during first months of LHC operation"), etc.

We don't see the reason to shorten it.

L184: Tag-and-Probe; also here I'd add a sentence or two explaining the basic idea of the T-n-P method;
We believe the reference is enough

it is equivalent, given is the ratio of the partial width to the total one.
