> OVERALL COMMENT
> Unanimously, we think that the paper reads quite nicely, the data analysis is thorough and the results interesting.
> In the following there is some redundancy in the comments. We thought it was better to let it in, because it helps to increase their significance.
> Comments to the figures are all grouped at the end, just before those to references.

> GENERAL COMMENTS
> -- One could improve the Introduction and or the Conclusions adding some physics statements which could expand the paper significance beyond a comparison of the data with some theoretical Monte Carlo models.
> 
> -- there are too many tables, the paper would benefit if the results were summarized in the text or, were applicable, with a figure and then put a reference where one could collect all the details.
> 
> -- the amount of work is impressive as testified by the mega-tables, however sometimes not much it is said where the reader would expect more, as for instance in section 7.
> In section 4.1 about the polarization if J/psi's from B decays (lines 144-145) no information is given but the BaBar reference.
> For formula (7) there is a reference to a ALEPH work, which, when looking at, does not provide more information: maybe there is a better reference o maybe one can simply say something more.
> 
> -- the repeated reference to PAS for some basic information like: vertex definition, Tracker Muon, Tag &probe are very annoying and derating the paper readability and impact. As noted in the detailed comments, it would be sufficient to insert a short description of the subject before referencing to the PAS.
> 
> -- Numbers are often given with decimal values that are not significant or warranted by the corresponding errors. Errors are frequently reported with three significant digits. In addition, sometimes the best values are reported with a number of significant digits that does not correspond to the error (see e.g Table 4, last column: (9.14 +- 1.3) (35 +- 5.3) ¡Ä.). See also specific comments.
> 
> -- in table 6 the systematic errors should have a significant statistical component, because there are clear fluctuations between contiguous bins.
> For instance, in the section for 1.6 < y < 2.4, in the "vertex estimation" column in the 3 consecutive bins in pT of lines from 3 to 5, one reads : 85, 4, 43;
> in the next column "background fit", the lines from 2 to 5 read : 11, 168, 1, 27
