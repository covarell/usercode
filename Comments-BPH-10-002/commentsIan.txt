I think in the end we will remove the sentence about the three layers since,
as Stoyan is poiting out, the only requirement on the acceptance is the
three lines above line 133.

The weighted measured uncertainty with properly weighted errors has an
uncertainty which is smaller than 20%. So we conservatively take this number.

OK. It's uncorrected, we will make it clear.

Right.

Because in the inclusive cross-section measurement a "general" hypothesis
on the acceptance must be taken. When the two contributions are separated out, 
one can re-weight the B part for the acceptance corresponding the measured 
polarization by Babar, corresponding to lambda_HX ~ -0.41.

Not so easy, being a LateX float, but we will try.

Ok.

Done.

OK.

OK.

Fine.
