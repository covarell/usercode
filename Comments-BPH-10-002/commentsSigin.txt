In general

(1) throughout the paper (including the Abstract, text and references, 
etc.),
the "b-hadron" (as well as "b-fraction", etc.) and "B-hadron" (as well as 
"B-fraction", etc.) are used mixedly. It seems should make them all 
consistent.


Page 1

(2) L5, I presume that the "J/psi's" indicates the plural of "J/psi", if 
so, it
seems should change from

"non-prompt J/psi's from the decay of a b-hadron." -->
"non-prompt J/psi's from the decay of b-hadrons." or
"non-prompt J/psi's from the decay of B-hadrons."

depending on which consistent expression would be used as mention in the 
above 
item (1).


(3) L32, it seems slightly better to add 3 words as
"The paper finishes with some comparisons ..." -->
"The paper finishes in Section 7 with some comparisons ..."

(4) L34, the "Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS)" has already mentioned in L25,
thus, here it can be
"Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS)" -->
"CMS"

(5) L37, the "ECAL" and "HCAL" have never been used elsewhere in this
paper, so they seem can be deleted as
"calorimeter (ECAL) and the brass/scintillator hadron calorimeter (HCAL)." 
-->
"calorimeter and the brass/scintillator hadron calorimeter."


Page 2

(6) L70, it seems should add a word as
"the leading-order singlet" -->
"the leading-order color singlet"


Page 3

(7) L93, as the other few clauses in the sentence started from "must", so
a "must have" seems should be added as
"pixel layers, a chi2 per degree of freedom smaller than four, and 
must pass" -->
"pixel layers, must have a chi2 per degree of freedom smaller than four, 
and 
must pass"


(8) L97, it seems clearer if adding two words as
"between the extrapolated track and the segment ..." -->
"between the extrapolated track from Tracker and the segment

(9) The 3rd-4th lines below L99, I'm not sure whether the clause 
after the colon ":" is referring to the all systematic uncertainties 
listed before the ":" or not;

    (a) if yes, then it may should be changed from

": this can shift ..." -->
"; these can shift ..." 
(please notice that the ":" may be better to be changed to ";")

    (b) if not, i.e. it only refers to the last systematic (i.e. the 
"sub-detector 
misalignment and biases in the algorithms which fit the track 
trajectory"),
then the clause in 3rd-4th lines may be better to be changed from

": this can shift ... of dimuon resonances." -->
" (this can shift ... of dimuon resonances)."
(please notice that the ":" is replaced by a bracket)


(10) L102, I'm not sure what the "expected mass distributions" is 
referring 
to, would it be possible to explain briefly what is the "expected"?


(11) In the caption of Table 1, according to the common expression of many 
other CMS papers and HEP papers, all Equation series numbers in the text 
should be in a bracket, i.e.
"Eq.1" -->
"Eq.(1)"

These are also the case in L135 and L152 for Eq.(2), and L276 for Eq.(10).


(12) The 1st line in Table 1, the error of "a1" is a half of the a1 value,
I'm not sure what is the reason for it and whether it would cause any 
concerns.


(13) L110, it prints that "the combination with the purest muon content is 
chosen",

    (a) so far in this paper, the definition of the "purity" has not been 
given
yet. It seems better to give the definition somewhere prior it is used.

    (b) If always the Global muon is purer than the Tracker muon, whether 
we can
simply change from 
"the combination with the purest muon content is chosen" -->
"the combination with the Global muon is chosen


(14) L112,

    (a) it prints that "the one with the largest pT is chosen". I'm not 
sure whether this pT is referring to the the vector sum of two pT's in the 
pair? Or something else? It seems better to be explained more precisely.

    (b) it seems better to add a comma as
"On average 1.07 J/psi" -->
"On average, 1.07 J/psi"
 

Page 4

(15) in Figure 1, in each sub-figures, it seems better to enlarge the 
letter sizes of "sigma = xxx MeV/c2" and "xxx < |y(J/psi)| < xxx".


(16) L118, according to the style of all other Section and sub-Section
titles, it should be changed from
"4 Acceptance and Efficiency" -->
"4 Acceptance and efficiency"


(17) L124-125, I'm not sure whether it would be better to explain 
briefly how the "material in front of the muon detectors, acting as an 
absorber" will "introduce a momentum threshold".


Page 5

(18) the 4th line, it prints that "to guarantee a single-muon 
detectability exceeding about 10%". I'm not sure whether the reason
for choosing the "10%" should be briefed, i.e. readers may quite be
possible to ask why not to choose 20%, 40% or any other numbers.


(19) L135, it prints that "Monte Carlo reconstructed dimuon variables
used in the numerator of Eq. 2.". The numerator of Eq.(2) is 
Ndet(pT,y,lambda(theta)), would it means that the "pT,y,lambda(theta)" are
"Monte Carlo reconstructed dimuon variables"? In any case, the sentence
in L135 seems not very clear to readers, and may be better to be 
re-phrased.


(20) L136, it seems better to add 2 words as
"is given in Fig. 2 for ..." -->
"is given in Fig. 2 (left figure) for ..."

(21) L138, it seems better to add 4 words as
"Also shown is the ..." -->
"Also shown in the right figure is the ..."

(22) the line below L138, it seems clearer to change from

"of the muon pairs within  100 MeV/c2 from the PDG J/psi mass." -->
"for the number of muon pairs within  100 MeV/c2 from the J/psi mass
given by PDG (Particle Data Group)."


(23) in Fig.2, the vertical axes on the right side of each sub-figures 
should add the labels of

    (a) the "Acceptance" for the left figure;
    (b) the "Number of mu pair" for the right figure.


(24) in the 2nd line of the caption of Fig.2, two words seem should be
added as
"two-dimensional distribution of the muon pairs" -->
"two-dimensional distribution of the number of muon pairs"


(25) L140, two words seem should be added as
"The dependence on the J/psi polarization" -->
"The dependence of Acceptance on the J/psi polarization"


(26) L142, I'm not sure whether it would be better to change from
"where the polarization is not well known at present" -->
"where the polarization is not well measured at present yet"

(27) L150-152, it seems to me that a percentage number should be quoted 
for this 1st item of systematic uncertainties.


Page 6

(28) L155, according to the expressions in most cases in this paper, 
"(see Sect. 7)" -->
"(see Section 7)"

(29) L163, it seems better to change from
"at the permille level" -->
"at the 0.1% level"

(30) L172, it seems better to add one comma as
"As a conservative estimate a bias equivalent to ..." -->
"As a conservative estimate, a bias equivalent to ...'

(31) L184, two dashes seem should be added as
"Tag and Probe method" -->
"Tag-and-Probe method"

There are also the same cases in L199 and L203.


(32) L185-186, it prints that "eff(off|track) is the muon identification 
in the muon systems for a tracker-reconstructed muon". There is no a word
in the explanation relating with the "off" in the "eff(off|track)" yet. 
Would it be better to re-phrase it so that the "off" can be explicitly 
explained?


Page 7

(33) L194, it prints that "value of rho is 0.095 with a RMS of 0.11"

    (a) I wonder how the RMS is larger than the value, and whether it 
should 
be explained;

    (b) a period is missing at the end, and it should be added in.


(34) L208, according to the expressions in most cases in this paper, 
"(see Sec. 7)" -->
"(see Section 7)"

(35) L211, L216 and in Eq.(5), the letter size of "corr" in the "N(corr)" 
is 
looked a little too large, it is better to change to a smaller letter 
size.


Page 8

(36) L240, a reference should be given to the uncertainty (of 11%) on the 
luminosity, as well as in the 3rd line of Table 3's caption on Page 9.

(37) L245, it seems better to add one word as
"the first bin in the forward rapidity region" -->
"the first pT bin in the forward rapidity region"


Page 10

(38) in the 1st line of Table 4's caption, would the table be about the 
inclusive 
cross section? If yes, a word seems should be added as 
"Table 4: Differential cross sections, and ..." -->
"Table 4: Inclusive differential cross sections, and ..."

(39) in Table 4,

    (a) it can be seen that

the result data in the column of "lambda(theta-CS)=-1" are all larger than 
the result data in the column of "lambda(theta-CS)=+1" for the first 
rapidity 
range (i.e. |y|<1.2).

This is opposite to all other cases, i.e. for all "lambda(theta-HX)" cases
and other 2 rapidity ranges [including the cases for the 
lambda(theta-CS)], i.e.

the result data in the column of "lambda=-1" are mostly smaller than
the result data in the column of "lambda=+1"

Should we highlight this difference to readers? If yes, should we try to 
explain
this difference?

(b) a few data numbers have only one significant digit or without digit 
after
the decimal point, I'm not sure whether they can be adjusted as,

for |y|<1.2, in the pT bin of 4.5-5.5 GeV/c, the column of 
lambda(theta-HX)=-1, from
"10.7 +- 2" -->
"10.7 +- 2.0"

for 1.2<|y|<1.6, in the pT bin of 3.5-4.5 GeV/c, the column of 
lambda(theta-CS)=-1, from
"37.3 +- 6" -->
"37.3 +- 6.0"

for 1.6<|y|<2.4, in the pT bin of 1.0-1.25 GeV/c, the column of 
lambda(theta-CS)=+1, from
"152.4 +- 28" -->
"152.4 +- 28.0"

in the pT bin of 2.5-2.75 GeV/c, the column of lambda(theta-HX)=+1, from

"113.2 +- 19" -->
"113.2 +- 19.0"

next line in the same column, from

"91.55 +- 14" -->
"91.55 +- 14.0"

in the pT bin of 3.25-3.5 GeV/c, the column of lambda(theta-HX)=-1, from

"52.1 +- 7.81" -->
"52.1 +- 7.8"


Page 11

(40) L257

    (a) it prints "a large component is considered", would it be possible 
to 
explain the component of what here is referring?

    (b) it prints "(see below)", it seems better to be a little more 
precise on
(see below in xxxx Section).


(41) in the line below L258, is it possible to give a name for the 
quantity of
"l(J/psi)", then, it can be changed from

"the quantity l(J/psi) =" -->
"the 'name' l(J/psi) ="


Page 12

(42) in the line below Eq.(8), a word seems should be added as 
"and m the invariant mass of the muon pair." -->
"and m is the invariant mass of the muon pair."

(43) L276, it seems slightly better to change the "of" to "in", as
"shape of the non-prompt component of Eq. 10" -->
"shape of the non-prompt component in Eq.(10)"

(44) L283, it may make things slightly clearer if two spaces can be 
inserted as
"[2.6,2.9] and [3.3,3.5]" -->
"[2.6, 2.9] and [3.3, 3.5]


Page 13

(45) in Figure 4, the conditions

    (a) "2 < pT(J/psi) < 4.5 GeV/c and 1.2 < |y| < 1.6" should be 
indicated inside
the left figure;

    (b) "6.5 < pT(J/psi) < 10 GeV/c and 1.6 < |y| < 2.4" should be 
indicated inside
the right figure;


(46) In the 3rd line of the Table 5's caption, it seems should be more 
precise to
give the explicit section number as
"(see next section)." -->
"(see Section xxx.xxx).


Page 14

(47) L297-298, it seems should add a word as
"between the results with the nominal model and with these models ..." -->
"between the results with the nominal model and with these misaligned 
models ..."

(48) L300, a typo
"a exponential decay" -->
"an exponential decay"

(49) L308, according to the expression everywhere in this paper,
"100 MeV/c2" -->
"100 MeV/(italic)c2'

(50) L316, it should be changed from
"is given in Tab. 6." -->
"is given in Table 6."

(51) in the caption of Table 6, the "absolute systematic uncertainties" 
has 
never been used elsewhere in this paper, would the "absolute" be needed to 
be
explained or deleted?


Page 15

(52) L320 and L324, would the italic "prompt" be necessary? If yes, please 
enlighten me the reason; if not, please change them to be "non-italic".

(53) L321, I'm not sure whether it would be better to add two words as
"7 Comparison with model calculations" -->
"7 Comparison with the theoretical model calculations"

(54) L325, it should be changed from
"(see Sec. 3.1)" -->
"(see Section 3.1)"


Page 17

(55) in Fig.5, in all labels on (horizontal and vertical) axes, it should 
be
changed from
"GeV" -->
"GeV/c"

(56) I presume that the data points for the bottom-right figure (i.e. 
|y|<2.4)
should be a summation of other 3 sub-figures, but I'm curious why the 
current
bottom-right figure only has 3 data points which is much less than the 
summation
of other 3 sub-figures.

There is a same case in the Fig.6 on Page 18.

(57) L350, since it has not been mentioned yet before the conclusion about 
the 
"region where the theoretical calculation has under-estimation", I'm not 
sure whether it should be changed from

"where the calculations underestimate the measured yield." -->
"where the calculations underestimate the measured yield as shown in the
bottom-left figures of Figs. 5 and 6."


Pages 19-21, in References Section,

(58) Titles of articles in Ref. [1]-[4], [7], [9]-[13], [18], [28] and 
[34] 
should be added.

(59) For consistency, all references should have only one page number
instead of two. The ones which need to be modified are Refs. [19]-[22], 
[33]-[35], [42] and [43].

(60) According to the common practices in all HEP papers, if the number
of authors is more than 3, only the 1st author is put in the Reference 
plus "et al.", instead of "2 or 3 names + et al." The ones which need 
to be modified are Refs. [6], [41] and [47].

(61) in Ref.[2], 
"A 21 (2006) 3857" -->
"A(bold)21 (2006) 3857"

Please notice that there should be no space between "A" and "21".

There are the similar cases for Refs. [9], [28], [32], [33], [44] and 
[45].


(62) in Ref.[14],
"(2008) 0803:S08004." -->
"0803(bold) (2008) S08004."

There is a similar case for Ref. [17].

(63) L374, the author(s) is(are) missing.

(64) in Ref.[23],
"5:T03009 (2010)." -->
"5 (2010) T03009(non-bold)."

There is a similar case for Ref. [25].

(65) L402, I'm curious about the long name of "T. U. A. D. Frawley", would 
you
please cross-check it?
