Dear Sijin,

thanks for the very careful reading of the paper. 
Please find our replies below.

Notice that all grammar and style comments have been taken into account
and implemented in the paper, if not differently specified.

OK.

Yes, although this is a standard description of the CMS detector, and maybe
should be left as is.

No, this is clear (tracks = Tracker tracks is explained in the first sentence 
of the paragraph).

Yes.

OK.

Personally I would leave "this" (meaning: the fact that the p measurement is affected..). 
I think "these" might be interpreted as referring to the "biases in the algorithms" alone.

It is the "ideal" case of a mass distribution where muon resolution effects
are centered at zero and independent of the pseudorapidity, taken from MC.
Details are given in reference [27], unfortunately there is no room for  
a detailed description here.

It simply means that the correction is too small to be significantly
different from 0 with the available statistics. This error is taken into 
account in the acceptance systematics (lines 169-175).

No, because there are two muons per combination, so you have three purity
levels: Global muon + Global muon, Global muon + Tracker muon, Tracker muon
+ Tracker muon. We think that "purity" has a standard definition: it is the
ratio of the number genuine events (muons in this case) and the number of
fakes.

Yes, it is the vector sum. We can change to "combined pT".

Ok, but see also answers to Giovanni on the same topic.

I think readers are expected to be familiar with the notion of particle range
when traversing a material.

Well, there is no actual reason for choosing this number rather than 20%.
It was just a reasonable assumption based on the fact that muon efficiencies
have typical errors of the order of %, so if the single muon efficiency is
below 10%, the relative uncertainty turns out to be large.

Yes.

Other reviewers too have had problems understanding this sentence, so we will
change it.

I don't know if ROOT supports palette labeling. We will try.

No, "known" also includes uncertainties in the theoretical description.

It is reported in table 3 per each bin (3rd column from the left).

We will leave the word "permille".

This will be changed to "id" (see answers to Teresa).

See answers to Giovanni. Because it's not a statistical error, but a
RMS over the values per bin: since in some bins rho is not compatible with 0
(hence the correction) the RMS is larger than the mean. This sentence will
be changed or removed.

This is the CMS LaTex style. It will change once the writeup is sent to the
journal.

Correct! We should add PAS EWK-10-004.

It is the simple observation that polarizations in different frames have a
crossing point in the forward and middle regions. 2D figures proving that
are available in the Analysis note and we can also provide |y|-integrated
acceptances (we did it for the PAS).

Yes, all of these need to be adjusted (a problem of automatic formatting).

This sentence is not correct and will be removed (also other reviewers
noticed that).

The name given by TeVatron people is "pseudo-proper decay length", but some
CMS people do not like it.

We tried, but either they don't fit or the font is too small to be read.

The sentence in parenthesis will be removed anyway.

"Misaligned models" is not very nice. But we agree we should find something
better than "models".

"Absolute" is opposed to "relative" or "fractional".
We don't know a better English word.

The use of "the" seems not appropriate here.
Maybe "Comparison with theoretical calculations" is a good compromise.

Because we only sum when we have non-zero acceptance in all |y| regions
(see replies to Giovanni).

We also considered all your comments on the bibliography. Are we sure that 
article titles should be added and not removed everywhere? PRD and PRL for 
sure don't want titles in the bibliography, but I have no idea about EPJ-C.
