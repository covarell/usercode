I leave Carlos the detailed answer. The short one is that we need a few 
tens of pb-1 and it belongs to a separate paper.

We can easily give two tables showing the muon-id and muon-trigger 
efficiencies, and provide two plots for comparison with the MC.
All of this will be included very soon in the AN: we don't know (for space
reasons) how much of that should be included in the paper.

Exact. We compute the Acceptance from the MC, while the muon efficiencies are computed from the data.

The two are compatible indeed, but in the end we use the data T&P efficiencies 
and correct for the difference between the MC T&P and the true MC 
efficiencies, which arises from the bias that the "tag" muon introduces to 
the "probe" spectra.

Here are the details:

Indeed we correct for the difference between  the T&P MC efficiency and 
the true MC efficiency.

>My point is that only A*eff is well defined - A and eff alone are subjective in some extent.

It is only mildly subjective, even if we introduced a strict criterion to 
divide the two: the Acceptance is provided by the "detectabiliy" criterion that each muon should
lie within the geometric acceptance of the muon detectors and have enough momentum to
cross at least three active layers in any of the muon stations -
see Eq. (2) and Section 4.1. The efficiency can be measured from the data once
this criterion is applied, thus factorizing them. We set the detectability 
criterion to a minimum acceptance of a single muon (roughly 10% 
acceptance*efficiency).

>In the same context, Tab 2, A*eff uncertainties: which is the leading source - A or eff
>(probably it vary with bins?)? 

The systematics from the FSR, pT calibration, B-fraction and non-prompt 
polarization are all coming through A and in fact are negligible compared to 
the others which are instead coming from the efficiency or fit function.
Some columns will be probably removed as the effect is zero (see answer to
Carlos).

Yes, indeed. Remember however that:
1) the systematics from the luminosity - in common to all bins - is 11%.
2) the muon efficiency is a "systematics", strictly speaking, but it is
exapected to decrease as the muon statistics increases.

>When do you expect "irreducible" systematics to dominate?

Not easy to say. Since one of the dominant sources is luminosity, it mostly
depends on when/how its uncertainty can be reduced. 

>Eq 6. : For which polarization is this? "Null"?

Yes
>Does it make sense to try to give an estimate for the cross-section in the whole phase space?

We preferred to give it only for a region which is easily described 
(pT > pT0, |y| < y0). The full phase space is complicated as it depends on 
the detector acceptance contours, which are unique to CMS, so it is not very 
relevant for a physics measurement.

>Systematics and Table 3 : You have the misalignment in the tracker specially considered for the B-fraction.
>Why isn't it important here (or where is it absorbed? did you make a cross-check with it in some way)?

(WAIT FOR ERNEST)
We have checked that the different alignment geometries influence less than 1% the yields of the 
prompt and non-prompt Jpsi from the B-fraction measurement. We do not expect they will change the inclusive
yield more than that - somehow we expect a smaller effect. 
We did not try explicitly.
In principle aligment effects on the muon pT (which is the only thing that
matters here) are included in the muon momentum scale correction and the
uncertainty assigned to that should include also this contribution.

This sentence must be removed anyway or at least rephrased. It's noy true 
anymore since the Pythia estimate has been corrected. Thanks for the catch.

>Section 8 ("Conclusions"): The first result given is for the "Null" hypothesis, isn't it?
>Just not clear to me.

Yes.

>General: Did you try comparing results obtained from TT and GG muon pairs? Are they consistent?

No, we did not. It would require a lot more work. In addition, exclusive TT 
and exclusive GG will differ as the two are just covering different regions 
in phase space, therefore the trigger efficiency is very different ... etc.

Yes. Right.

PDG mass.

OK.
