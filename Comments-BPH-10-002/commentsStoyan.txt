Dear Stoyan,

thanks for your useful comments.

See Carlos' detailed answer. The short one is that we need a few 
tens of pb^-1 and it belongs to a separate paper.

We can easily give two tables showing the muon-id and muon-trigger 
efficiencies, and provide two plots for comparison with the MC.
All of this is being included in the AN: we don't know (for space
reasons) how much of that should be included in the paper. Probably we will
go for the efficiency table only.

Exactly. We compute the acceptance from the MC, while the muon efficiencies 
are computed from the data.

The two are compatible indeed, but in the end we use the data T&P efficiencies 
and correct for the difference between the MC T&P and the true MC 
efficiencies, which arises from the bias that the "tag" muon introduces to 
the "probe" spectra.

Here are the plots proving that:

Indeed we correct for the difference between the T&P MC efficiency and 
the true MC efficiency, as mentioned in the paper.

>My point is that only A*eff is well defined - A and eff alone are subjective in some extent.

It is only mildly subjective, if we introduced a strict criterion to 
divide the two: the acceptance is provided by the "detectabiliy" criterion 
that each muon should lie within the geometric acceptance of the muon 
detectors and have enough momentum to
cross at least three active layers in any of the muon stations -
see Eq. (2) and Section 4.1. The efficiency can be measured from the data once
this criterion is applied, thus factorizing them. We set the detectability 
criterion in order to correspond to a minimum acceptance of a single muon 
(roughly 10% acceptance*efficiency).

>In the same context, Tab 2, A*eff uncertainties: which is the leading source - A or eff
>(probably it vary with bins?)? 

The systematics from the FSR, pT calibration, B-fraction and non-prompt 
polarization are all coming through A and in fact are negligible compared to 
the others which are instead coming from the efficiency or fit function.
Some columns will be probably removed as the effect is zero (see answer to
Carlos).

>true that the uncertainties of your results (cross-sections) are still statistically dominated?

Yes, indeed. Remember however that:
1) the systematics from the luminosity - in common to all bins - is 11%.
2) the muon efficiency is a "systematics", strictly speaking, but it is
exapected to decrease as the muon statistics increases.

>When do you expect "irreducible" systematics to dominate?

Not easy to say. Since one of the dominant sources is luminosity, it mostly
depends on when/how its uncertainty can be reduced by the lumi group. 

>Eq 6. : For which polarization is this? "Null"?

Yes

>Does it make sense to try to give an estimate for the cross-section in the whole phase space?
>

We preferred to give it only for a region which is easily described 
(pT > pT0, |y| < y0). The full phase space is complicated as it depends on 
the detector acceptance contours, which are unique to CMS, so it is not very 
relevant for a physics measurement.

>Systematics and Table 3 : You have the misalignment in the tracker specially considered for the B-fraction.
>Why isn't it important here (or where is it absorbed? did you make a cross-check with it in some way)?
>

We have checked that the different alignment geometries influence less 
than 1% the yields of the prompt and non-prompt Jpsi from the B-fraction 
measurement. We do not expect they will change the inclusive
yield more than that - somehow we expect a smaller effect. 

Also, in principle aligment effects on the muon pT (which is the only 
thing that matters here) are included in the muon momentum scale correction 
and the uncertainty assigned to that should include also this contribution.

>is "higher than expected" ? Could this be just the wrong polarization hypothesis?

This sentence must be removed anyway or at least rephrased. It's not true 
anymore since the Pythia estimate has been corrected. Thanks for the catch.

>Section 8 ("Conclusions"): The first result given is for the "Null" hypothesis, isn't it?
>Just not clear to me.

Yes.

>General: Did you try comparing results obtained from TT and GG muon pairs? Are they consistent?
>

No, we did not. It would require a lot more work. In addition, exclusive TT 
and exclusive GG will differ as the two are just covering different regions 
in phase space, therefore the trigger efficiency is very different ... etc.

>L 113 : "per event" -> "per selected event" (right?)

Yes. Right.

>
>Fig. 1 : if using SS data - give it with a different marker type (i.e. colorblind/black&white readable)

As per Carlos' comments, we will probably remove the SS data overall.
But an alternative plot with different marker types will be available, in case
the final decision is to show them.

>         Why not giving the fitted ("nominal"?) mass as well?

In a discussion with the muon momentum scale group it was decided not to 
give the nominal mass, since, even after the correction, is not compatible
with the PDG value in some pT-y bins:
 
http://cmsdoc.cern.ch/~covarell/Jpsinote/MassPlot.png

This is due to the muon momentum scale correction missing some terms, due
to insufficient statistics. So, waiting for a more final result on that, it
was agreed not to show the mass value (which is anyway not relevant for
the scope of the paper).

>Below L 138: "nominal J/Psi mass" - what is "nominal" (from the fit? PDG?)?

PDG mass.

>L 239: "noticed" -> "noted" (I think this is more "English" though I am not a native speaker)

OK.
