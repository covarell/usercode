I leave Carlos the detailed answer. The short one is that we need a few tens of pb-1 and it belongs to a separate paper.

We will probably give two tables showing the muon-id and muon-trigger efficiencies, and provide two plots for comparison with the MC.

Exact. We compute the Acceptance from the MC, while the muon efficiencies are computed from the data.

The two are compatible indeed, but in the end we use the data T&P efficiencies and correct for the difference between the
MC T&P and the true MC efficiencies, which
arises from the bias that the Tag Muon introduces to the Probe spectrum.
Here are the values:

>Shouldn't you introduce a correction factor of some kind (if not statistically compatible)?
Indeed we correct for the difference between  the T&P MC efficiency and the true MC efficiency.
>My point is that only A*eff is well defined - A and eff alone are subjective in some extend.
It is only mildly subjective, even if we introduced a strict criterion to divide the two: the Acceptance is provided by the "detectabiliy" criterion (Eq. 2) and Section 4.1. The efficiency can be measured from the data. We set the detectability criterion to the minimum acceptance of a single muon (10% acceptance efficiency).
>In the same context, Tab 2, A*eff uncertainties: which is the leading source - A or eff
>(probably it vary with bins?)? 
The systematics from the FSR, pT calibation, B-fraction and non-prompt polarization are all coming through A and in fact are negligible compared to the others which are instead coming from the efficiency or fit function.

Yes indeed. Remember however that the systematics from the luminosity - in common to all bins - is 11%.

Yes

We don't have a model.
>Systematics and Table 3 : You have the misalignment in the tracker specially considered for the B-fraction.

We did not try explicitly. The fit result do not vary from different alignments.

No, we did not. It would require a lot more work. In addition, the phase space covered from exclusive TT and exclusive GG will differ and the two are just covering different regions in phase space.
