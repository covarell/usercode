Dear Amnon,

We saw this construction in other English documents, but we are not sure this
is correct for a publication. Final reading will probably set this issue.

A mixture of the two is present. That should be fine in our opinion.

OK. We will go through the paper checking this.

Right. We will remove it.

This sentence will be removed (see answers to Teresa).

OK.

This is taken verbatim from the Phys-TDR which was checked by native 
English speakers.

Fine for us.

Yes.

Correct.

See answers to Teresa. Details can be found in the referenced paper about 
generic reconstruction techniques in CMS: details are needed because, on 
the other hand, there is no general recipe in CMS about which muons should
be used for what (global only, inclusive tracker, standalone ... etc.) so
the choice is part of the analysis selection.

Right. See answers to Sijin.

Yes, it has (line 90).

Or also changing "mass distributions" to "mass shapes".

Really? We choose a candidate among two or more, we don't use it..

Right. This will be changed to "detector material".

OK.

See answers to Sijin. Quantitatively, this can be read in Fig. 2, as you
mention.

But then the sentence would read "the simulated reconstructed dimuon..."
(not nice)

This is different. We are not talking about the number of events here, but the
variables inside the parentheses (pT, y..)

> L142: "we chose"?

Yes, sure. The current form is italianized English...

From private communication with Pietro Faccioli, we concluded that in 
general what you say is true for directly produced particles but, if the
charmonium is a product of a heavy quark decay, the same polarization
is observed in the helicity frame irrespective of the production mechanism
of the parent particle. Citing:

"The following considerations apply to the perturbative production of a
c-cbar pair. The c-cbar will then evolve into the Jpsi and this phase may 
involve non-perturbative contributions; this is what, for example, is 
parametrized by the colour octet matrix elements in NRQCD.
However, we can obtain a zero-order estimate of the effect simply using
helicity and angular momentum conservation, neglecting what happens in
the non-perturbative evolution of the c-cbar state.

The elementary process is

b -> Jpsi + s (or d) quark

The participating quarks couple to W bosons (charged current) and are,
therefore, all left-handed. For the massless one (the final s or d)
left-handedness equals negative helicity: in the b rest frame,
therefore, the outgoing s/d quark always has the spin directed towards
the origin. Since the Jpsi+s/d system has spin 1/2, like the b that produced 
it, the total angular momentum projection along the Jpsi-s/d axis must be 
+1/2 or -1/2. Let's take the orientation of the axis in the direction of the 
Jpsi in the b rest frame. Since the spin of the quark is +1/2 (towards the 
origin), the Jpsi spin can be -1 or zero, but it cannot be +1. This means 
that the Jpsi, in this simplified picture, is
approximately 50% transverse (Jz = -1, but not +1) and 50% longitudinal
(J_z =0), and its decay distribution is therefore of the form
             1 - 1/3 cos^2theta
with respect to the J/psi momentum in the b rest frame."

True. We will change to "At generator level, the dimuon momentum ... etc."

Yes.

To 20-30% (so it's relative).

OK.

> L170: Doesn't this correction also apply to MC?

We will remove "in data".

The corrections are those applied to data in order to match MC. So, since we 
determine acceptance from MC and use it in data, we estimate this uncertainty.

> L172: Remove "below" (right now you're saying the maximum is below 0.05%,

OK.

> L172-175: very wordy. How about:

In fact this is not waht we do. 0.05% is the amount by which we shift the
muon momentum value in the two directions (+/- 0.05%). The resulting
difference in acceptance is taken as systematics.
 
> L176-177: Remove the first "also". "give a systematics on" --> "bias".

OK./OK.

> L150-176: 
> - what are the sizes of these uncertainties? Which ones are important?

They are reported in Table 3.

> - What about the charge-dependence and phi-modulation mentioned in 
> TRK-10-004?

These are efficiency effects, not acceptance. So they are measured from data
(Sect. 4.2) and uncertainties are included in the "muon efficiency" column.
 
> L188: "and varies only slightly"

Right.

> L194: Is the 0.11 used in the systematic uncertainties?

See answers to nearly all reviewers. This sentence conveys a lot of confusion
and should be either completely changed or removed.
 
> L195-198: Is background subtraction used? If so, it'll probably help to 
> mention the background levels in Fig. 1.

No, the background levels of Fig. 1 are done using also Tracker muons, so they
are much higher. Global Muons are almost background-free (and are the same
as the others for what concerns inner tracking which is used for vertex
efficiency estimation).

> Should this text be in the present tense?

It is already...

> L200: which distribution of the probe muon? How big is the difference?

Actually distributionS (pT and |eta|). How can we say "how big" the
difference between two distributions is? I mean, it's not a single number...

> 207-210: a) You varied by reweighting, these are not separate actions.

OK.

> b) why the plural "spectra"?

Should be "spectrum".

> c) this is a run-on sentence

???

> d) shouldn't this be in the present tense?

Yes.

General concern. We will post a solution in HN.

> L251: "of the event"?

We prefer "in the event".

OK.

No, it's PDG.

It is a vector, we will change that.

OK.

OK.

> L268: remove the first "the"

OK.

No, but they are constrained to peak at the same value.

OK.

> L281: what are "effective parameters"?

The slopes of the various exponentials, which do not reflect a true decay
time of a particle, since they are spurious di-muon combinations.   

> L284: "b" is italicized, unlike in rest of paper. Also, you often use a

OK.

5 bins taken randomly among the 15 (toy MC studies take a lot of time).

OK.

Isn't this a common statistical term (q_gen - q_fit/Deltaq, where q is any
parameter)?

OK.

We can, even if we think that this is the result of the measurement.

OK.

OK.

???

OK

J/psi is math style as in the rest of the paper. We don't know the standard
CMS rules for "pp".

Correct. We will copy it from the caption of Fig. 3.

OK.

We will drop "The", "some" and "in general".
