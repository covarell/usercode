Dear Teresa, 

Thanks for the careful reading of the paper. Please find below our comments.

We think that the quality of the paper is OK for a journal. We can answer
below to specific comments and make changes accordingly, but we don't know what
else to do to improve.

OK.

OK. We can change in "at least two independent muon segment at the hardware
etc."

Yes. We can change that.

We find too technical to mention muon seeding methods in a physics paper.
The description is missing, because the reference to the muon performance 
paper is given here. You can find the original description in the corresponding
passage of the Analysis Note, but it seemed to us very lengthy and 
technical for a physics paper.

Combination (as opposed to "two Global Muons")

We can move the "lever arm" statement from the caption to the text. The SS
dimuons are not used at all in the analysis to estimate the background: in 
fact, the opinion of some reviewers is to remove the SS distribution.
 
> Lines 131-132: is the last sentence necesary? I think no. 

Yes, it is. Otherwise we could have "rho-like" effects in the acceptance 
determination as we have in the muon efficiencies.

We can change "off" to "id". We think that the conditional efficiency is
necessary, otherwise the pure multiplication is not statistically correct.

We can remove "describe reasonably". The granularity is already there (between
parantheses.)

See answers to Giovanni. It would be probably better to remove everything.

See answers to Giovanni. This will be changed.

Yes.

Yes. We can change that.

Both this effect and the one in the table are due to the muon momentum
calibration. But one (shifting events between different pT bins) is
negligible, the other (effects on J/psi acceptance, see lines 169-181) is not.

See answers to Giovanni. This will be changed.

There are some. I don't know if we need to add also "We are forever
grateful to our LHC colleagues for the superb luminosity conditions... etc."
Probably yes.

See comment above.
